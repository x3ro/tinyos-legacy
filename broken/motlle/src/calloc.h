/* Module: calloc
   Date: 14 Feb 92
   Purpose: Fast & easy memory allocator for the mudlle compiler
     Based on the concept of blocks: you allocate memory from a block,
       and can free the whole block at one go.
       Individual deallocations are not possible.
*/

typedef struct memblock **block_t;

block_t new_block(void);
/* Return: A new block from which to allocate some memory.
*/

/* Effect: Free all memory allocated in block b.
*/

void *allocate(block_t b, uvalue size);
/* Effects: Allocates size bytes from block b. This block is aligned
     correctly for all objects.
   Returns: A pointer to the start of the block.
   Note: In this implementation, 12 + average(size)/2 bytes will be wasted
     for every BLOCK_SIZE bytes allocated (see calloc.c).
     Also, size must be smaller than BLOCK_SIZE
