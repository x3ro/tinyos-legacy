mudlle: MUD Language for Little Extensions
------------------------------------------

This software is Copyright (C) 1993-1999 David Gay and Gustav Hållberg.
Read the COPYRIGHT file for terms of use.

Installation
------------
To compile this software on x86/linux, just type 'make'.
To compile this software on sparc/solaris (using gcc), edit Makefile and
runtime/Makefile and uncomment/comment the appropriate lines.

Other 32-bit platforms should work as well, as long as: builtins.o and
x86builtins.o are removed from OBJS in Makefile, and options.h is edited
appropriately. Porting to 64-bit platforms will require changes to the
garbage collector (alloc.c) and the basic type layout (mvalues.h).

If you have the GNU gmp package installed, you can add -DUSE_GMP to the
CFLAGS in the Makefiles (or to options.h) to enable "big" (unlimited
precision) integers.

Quick Introduction
------------------

mudlle is a small language designed for writing extensions to MUME, an
online multi-user game. It is heavily inspired by Scheme. This
distribution contains a stand-alone interpreter and compiler that can
be used to experiment with the language. It is up to you to integrate
it with your favourite application if you wish to use it as an
extension language.

Once compiled, run mudlle and check that basic stuff works:
./mudlle
mudlle> 2+3
Result: 5
mudlle>

EOF (Ctrl-D), or evaluating quit() will exit the interpreter.

doc/mudlle-intro.doc and doc/mudlle-ref.doc contain a somewhat out of date
language introduction and reference. However, everything described in those
documents should still work.

A compiler is available for the x86/linux and sparc/solaris platforms. To
load it, type 
  load("sc.mud") // sparc/solaris compiler
or
  load("xc.mud") // x86/linux compiler
at the 'mudlle>' prompt.

To compile a file:
  compile("<filename.mud>")
This produces <filename.obj>.

To load a compiled file:
  fload("<filename.obj>");

See "slow.mud" (compile sparc/solaris compiler) and "csc.mud" (load compiled
sparc/solaris compiler) for other examples...

Remember, the source code is the documentation.
