This lesson introduces the TinyOS notion of <b>tasks</b>, which 
can be used to perform general-purpose "background" processing in an 
application. This lesson makes use of the <tt>Sense2</tt> application, 
which is a revision of the <tt>Sense</tt> application from the previous
lesson.

<p>
TinyOS provides a two-level scheduling hierarchy consisting of
<b>tasks</b> and <b>events</b>. As we have seen, an event is a 
generalization of an interrupt handler, a call that is made from
a lower-level component to a higher-level component in response to some
event. Events must only do a small amount of work before completing,
because events always run to completion and cannot be preempted. 
<b>Tasks</b> are used to perform longer processing operations, 
such as background data processing, that can be preempted by events.

<p>
A task is declared in your implementation module using the syntax
<pre>
  task void taskname() { ... }
</pre>
where <tt>taskname()</tt> is whatever symbolic name you want to assign
to the task. Tasks must return <tt>void</tt> and may not take any
arguments. 

<p>
To dispatch a task for (later) execution, use the syntax
<pre>
  post taskname();
</pre>
A task can be posted from within a command, an event, or even another task.

<p>
The <tt>post</tt> operation places the task on an internal <b>task
queue</b> which is processed in FIFO order. When a task is executed, it
runs to completion before the next task is run; therefore, a task should
not spin or block for long periods of time. Tasks do not preempt each
other, but a task can be preempted by events. If you need to run a 
series of long operations, you should dispatch a separate task for 
each operation, rather than using one task that spins in a loop.

<p>To illustrate tasks, we have modified the Sense application from
Lesson 2, which is found in <a
href="../../apps/Sense2"><tt>apps/Sense2</tt></a>.  The SenseM
component maintains a circular data buffer that contains recent photo
sensor samples; the <tt>putdata()</tt> function is used to insert a
new sample into the buffer. The <tt>dataReady()</tt> event simply
deposits data into the buffer and posts a task, called
<tt>processData()</tt>, for processing.

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>SenseM.nc</b>
<pre>
  // ADC data ready event handler
  event result_t ADC.dataReady(uint16_t data) {
    call Leds.yellowToggle();
    putdata(data);
    post processData();
    return SUCCESS;
  }
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>Some time after the event completes (there may be other tasks 
pending for execution), the <tt>processData()</tt> task will run. 
It computes the sum of the recent ADC samples and displays the upper
three bits of the sum on the LEDs.

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>SenseM.nc, continued</b>
<pre>
  task void processData() {
    int16_t i, sum=0;
    call Leds.greenToggle();
    for (i=0; i<maxdata; i++)
      sum += (data[i] >> 7);
    display(sum >> shiftdata);
  }
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

</tr></table>

<p>
Try to break up the <tt>processData()</tt> task so that each invocation
of the task only adds one element of the <tt>data</tt> array to the sum.
<tt>processData()</tt> should then post itself to continue processing
the complete sum, and display the LEDs when the final element of the
array has been processed. Be careful of concurrency issues - since
<tt>processData()</tt> is also posted from <tt>ADC.dataReady()</tt>,
you might want to add a flag to prevent a new instance of the task from
being started before the previous sum has been computed!
