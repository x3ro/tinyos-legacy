<p>
This lesson introduces two concepts: hierarchical decomposition of
component graphs, and using radio communication.
The applications that we will consider are 
<tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> and <tt>RfmToLeds</tt>. 
<tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> is a variant of <tt>Blink</tt> that outputs the
current counter value to multiple output interfaces: both the LEDs, and
the radio communication stack. 
<tt>RfmToLeds</tt> receives data from the radio and displays it on the
LEDs. Programming one mote with <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> will cause it
to transmit its counter value over the radio; programming another
with <tt>RfmToLeds</tt> causes it to display the received counter on its
LEDs - your first distributed application!

</tr></table>

<p>
Look at <tt>CntToRfmAndLeds.nc</tt>. Note that this application only
consists of a configuration; all of the component modules are located
in libraries!

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>CntToLedsAndRfm.nc</b>
<pre>
configuration CntToLedsAndRfm {
}
implementation {
  components Main, Counter, IntToLeds, IntToRfm, Clock;

  Main.StdControl -> Counter.StdControl;
  Main.StdControl -> IntToLeds.StdControl;
  Main.StdControl -> IntToRfm.StdControl;
  Counter.Clock -> ClockC;
  IntToLeds <- Counter.IntOutput;
  Counter.IntOutput -> IntToRfm;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
The first thing to note is that a single interface requirement
(such as <tt>Main.StdControl</tt> or <tt>Counter.IntOutput</tt>)
can be <em>fanned out</em> to multiple implementations. 
Here we wire <tt>Main.StdControl</tt> to the <tt>Counter</tt>,
<tt>IntToLeds</tt>, and <tt>IntToRfm</tt> components. 
(All of these components can be found in the <tt>tos/lib</tt>
directory.) The names of the various components tell you what they do:
<tt>Counter</tt> receives <tt>Clock.fire()</tt> events to maintain a
counter. <tt>IntToLeds</tt> and <tt>IntToRfm</tt> provide the 
<tt>IntOutput</tt> interface, that has a single command, <tt>output()</tt>,
which is called with a 16-bit value. <tt>IntToLeds</tt> displays the
lower three bits of its value on the LEDs, and <tt>IntToRfm</tt>
broadcasts the 16-bit value over the radio. 

<p>
So we're wiring the <tt>Counter.Clock</tt> interface to <tt>Clock</tt>,
and <tt>Counter.IntOutput</tt> to <b>both</b> <tt>IntToLeds</tt> and
<tt>IntToRfm</tt>. The NesC compiler generates code so that
all invocations of the <tt>Counter.IntOutput.output()</tt>
command will invoke the command in both <tt>IntToLeds</tt> and 
<tt>IntToRfm</tt>. Also note that the wiring arrow can go in either
direction: the arrow always points <em>from</em> a required interface
<em>to</em> a provided implementation.

<p>
Try building and installing this application; you should see a 3-bit
binary counter on the mote's LEDs. Of course the mote is also
transmitting the value over the radio, which we describe next.

<tt>IntToRfm</tt> is a simple component that receives an output value 
(through the <tt>IntOutput</tt> interface) and broadcasts it over the
radio. Radio communication in TinyOS follows the Active Message (AM) 
model, in which each packet on the network specifies a <em>handler ID</em>
that will be invoked on recipient nodes. Think of the handler ID as an
integer or "port number" that is carried in the header of the message. 
When a message is received, the receive event associated with that
handler ID is signalled. Different motes can associate different receive
events with the same handler ID.

<p>In any messaging layer, there are 5 aspects involved in successful 
communication:
<ol>
<li> Specifying the message data to send; 
<li> Specifying which node(s) are to receive the message;
<li> Determining when the memory associated with the outgoing message can 
be reused; 
<li> Buffering the incoming message; and, 
<li> Processing the message on reception
</ol>
In Tiny Active Messages, memory management is very constrained as you
would expect from a small-scale embedded environment.

<p>
Let's look at <tt>IntToRfm.nc</tt>:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>IntToRfm.nc</b>
<pre>
configuration IntToRfm
{
  provides interface IntOutput;
  provides interface StdControl;
}
implementation
{
  components IntToRfmM, GenericComm as Comm;

  IntOutput = IntToRfmM;
  StdControl = IntToRfmM;

  IntToRfmM.Send -> Comm.SendMsg[AM_INTMSG];
  IntToRfmM.StdControl -> Comm;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
This component provides the <tt>IntOutput</tt> and <tt>StdControl</tt>
interfaces. This is the first time that we have seen a
<em>configuration</em> provide an <em>interface</em>. In the previous
lessons we have always used configurations just to wire other components
together; in this case, the <tt>IntToRfm</tt> configuration is itself a
component that another configuration can wire to. Got it?

<p>
In the implementation section, we see:
<pre>
  components IntToRfmM, GenericComm as Comm;
</pre>
The phrase "<tt>GenericComm as Comm</tt>" is stating that this
configuration uses the <tt>GenericComm</tt> component, but gives it
the (local) name <tt>Comm</tt>. The idea here is that you can easily
swap in a different communication module in place of
<tt>GenericComm</tt>, and only need to change this one line to do so;
you don't need to change every line that wires to <tt>Comm</tt>.

<p>
We also see some new syntax here in the lines:
<pre>
  IntOutput = IntToRfmM;
  StdControl = IntToRfmM;
</pre>
The equal sign (<tt>=</tt>) is used to indicate that the
<tt>IntOutput</tt> interface provided by <tt>IntToRfm</tt> 
<b>is "equivalent to"</b> the implementation in <tt>IntToRfmM</tt>.
We can't use the arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>) here, because the arrow is used
to wire a required interface to a provided implementation. In this case
we are "equating" the interfaces provided by <tt>IntToRfm</tt> 
with the implementation found in <tt>IntToRfmM</tt>. 

<p>
The last two lines of the configuration are:
<pre>
  IntToRfmM.Send -> Comm.SendMsg[AM_INTMSG];
  IntToRfmM.StdControl -> Comm;
</pre>
The last line is simple; we're wiring <tt>IntToRfmM.StdControl</tt> to
<tt>GenericComm.StdControl</tt>. The first line shows us another
use of <b>parameterized interfaces</b>, in this case, wiring up
the <tt>Send</tt> interface of <tt>IntToRfmM</tt> to the 
<tt>SendMsg</tt> interface provided by <tt>Comm</tt>.

<p>The <tt>GenericComm</tt> component declares:
<pre>
  provides {
    interface SendMsg[uint8_t id];
  }
</pre>
In other words, it provides 256 different instances of the
<tt>SendMsg</tt> interface, one for each <tt>uint8_t</tt> value.
This is the way that Active Message handler IDs are wired together.
In <tt>IntToRfm</tt>, we are wiring the <tt>SendMsg</tt> interface
corresponding to the handler ID <tt>AM_INTMSG</tt> to 
<tt>GenericComm.SendMsg</tt>. (<tt>AM_INTMSG</tt> is a global value 
defined in <tt>tos/lib/IntMsg.h</tt>.) When the <tt>SendMsg</tt> command is
invoked, the handler ID is provided to it, essentially as an 
extra argument. You can see how this works by looking at
<tt>tos/system/AMStandard.nc</tt> (the implementation module
for <tt>GenericComm</tt>):
<pre>
  command result_t SendMsg.send[uint8_t id]( ... ) { ... };
</pre>
Of course, parameterized interfaces aren't strictly necessary here - the 
same thing could be accomplished if <tt>SendMsg</tt> took the handler 
ID as an argument. This is just an example of the use of parameterized 
interfaces in NesC.

<p>
Now we know how <tt>IntToRfm</tt> is wired up, but we don't know how
message communication is implemented. Take a look at the
<tt>IntOutput.output()</tt> command in <tt>IntToRfmM.nc</tt>:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>IntToRfmM.nc</b>
<pre>
  bool pending;
  struct TOS_Msg data;

  /* ... */ 

  command result_t IntOutput.output(uint16_t value) {
    IntMsg *message = (IntMsg *)data.data;

    if (!pending) {
      pending = TRUE;

      message->val = value;
      message->src = TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS;

      if (call Send.send(TOS_BCAST_ADDR, sizeof(IntMsg), &data))
        return SUCCESS;

      pending = FALSE;
    }  
    return FAIL;
  }
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
The command is using a message structure called <tt>IntMsg</tt>,
declared in <tt>tos/lib/IntMsg.h</tt>. It is a simple struct with
<tt>val</tt> and <tt>src</tt> fields; the first being the data value and
the second being the message's source address. We assign these two
fields (using the global constant <tt>TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS</tt> for the
local source address) and call <tt>Send.send()</tt> with the 
destination address (<tt>TOS_BCAST_ADDR</tt> is the radio broadcast
address), the message size, and the message data.

<p>
The "raw" message data structure used by <tt>SendMsg.send()</tt> is 
<tt>struct TOS_Msg</tt>, declared in <tt>tos/system/AM.h</tt>.
It contains fields for the destination address, message type
(the AM handler ID), length, payload, etc. The maximum payload
size is <tt>TOSH_DATA_LENGTH</tt> and is set to 29 by default;
you are welcome to experiment with larger data packets but some 
nontrivial hacking of the code may be required :-)
Here we are encapsulating an <tt>IntMsg</tt> within the data payload
field of the <tt>TOS_Msg</tt> structure.

<p>
The <tt>SendMsg.send()</tt> command is split-phase; it
signals the <tt>SendMsg.sendDone()</tt> event when the message
transmission has completed. If <tt>send()</tt> succeeds, 
the message is queued for transmission, and if it fails, the
messaging component was unable to accept the message.

<p>
TinyOS Active Message buffers follow a strict alternating 
ownership protocol to avoid expensive memory management, while still allowing 
concurrent operation. If the message layer accepts the 
<tt>send()</tt> command, it owns 
the send buffer and the requesting component should not modify the buffer 
until the send is complete (as indicated by the <tt>sendDone()</tt> event). 

<p>
<tt>IntToRfmM</tt> uses a <tt>pending</tt> flag to keep track of the 
status of the buffer. If the previous message is still being sent, 
we cannot modify the buffer, so we drop the <tt>output()</tt> operation. 
If the send buffer is available, we can fill in the buffer and send
a message.

<p>
Recall that <tt>IntToRfm</tt>'s <tt>SendMsg</tt> interface is wired to
<tt>GenericComm</tt>, a "generic" TinyOS network stack implementation
(found in <tt>tos/system/GenericComm.nc</tt>). If you look at
the <tt>GenricComm.nc</tt>, you'll see that it makes use of a number
of low-level interfaces to implement communication: <tt>AMStandard</tt>
to implement Active Message sending and reception, 
<tt>UARTNoCRCPacket</tt> to communicate over the mote's serial port,
<tt>RadioCRCPacket</tt> to communicate over the radio,
and so forth. You don't need to understand all of the details of these
modules but you should be able to follow the <tt>GenericComm.nc</tt>
wiring configuration by now. 

<p> 
If you're really curious, check out
<tt>AMStandard.nc</tt> for some details on how the ActiveMessage layer
is built. For example, it implements <tt>SendMsg.send()</tt> by posting
a task to take the message buffer and send it over the serial port
(if the desintation address is <tt>TOS_UART_ADDR</tt> or the radio
radio (if the destination is anything else). You can dig down through
the various layers of code until you see the mechanism that actually
transmits a byte over the radio or UART.

face="arial,helvetica">Receiving Messages with RfmToLeds</font></b></nobr></td>
</tr></table>

<p>
The <tt>RfmToLeds</tt> application is defined by a simple configuration
that uses the <tt>RfmToInt</tt> component to receive a message, and the
<tt>IntToLeds</tt> component to display the received value on the LEDs.
Like <tt>IntToRfm</tt>, the <tt>RfmToInt</tt> component uses 
<tt>GenericComm</tt> to receive messages. Most of <tt>RfmToInt.nc</tt>
should be familiar to you by now, but look at the line:
<pre>
  RfmToIntM.ReceiveIntMsg -> GenericComm.ReceiveMsg[AM_INTMSG];
</pre>
This is how we specify that Active Messages received with the
<tt>AM_INTMSG</tt> handler ID should be wired to the 
<tt>RfmToIntM.ReceiveMsg</tt> interface. The direction of the arrow
might be a little confusing here. The <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt> interface
(found in <tt>tos/interfaces/ReceiveMsg.nc</tt>) <b>only</b>
declares an event: <tt>receive()</tt>, which is signalled with a pointer
to the received message. So <tt>RfmToIntM</tt> <em>uses</em> 
the <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt> interface, although that interface does not
have any commands to call -- just an event that can be signalled.

<p>
Memory management for incoming messages is inherently dynamic.
A message arrives an fills a buffer, and the Active Message layer
decodes the handler type and dispatches it. The buffer is handed to the
application componet (through the <tt>ReceiveMsg.receive()</tt> event),
but, critically, <b>the application component must return a pointer 
to a buffer upon completion</b>.

<p>
For example, looking at <tt>RfmToIntM.m</tt>,

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>RfmToIntM.nc</b>
<pre>
  /* ... */
  event TOS_MsgPtr ReceiveIntMsg.receive(TOS_MsgPtr m) {
    IntMsg *message = (IntMsg *)m->data;
    call IntOutput.output(message->val);

    return m;
  }
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Note that the last line returns the original message buffer, since the
application is done with it. If your component needs to save the message
contents for later use, it needs to copy the message to a new buffer,
or return a new (free) message buffer for use by the network stack.

<p>
TinyOS messages contain a "group ID" in the header, which allows multiple
distinct groups of motes to share the same radio channel. If you have
multiple groups of motes in your lab, you should set the group ID to a
unique 8-bit value to avoid receiving messages for other groups.
You set the group ID by setting
<pre>
  DEFAULT_LOCAL_GROUP = 0x42    # for example...
</pre>
in your <tt>Makefile</tt>, before the line that includes <tt>Makerules</tt>.
The default group ID is <tt>0x7D</tt>.

<p>In addition, the message header carries the destination node number,
which is a 16-bit value. We have also seen that the destination address 
can be <tt>TOS_BCAST_ADDR</tt> to broadcast to all nodes or
<tt>TOS_UART_ADDR</tt> to send to the serial port. To specify the local
address of your mote, when you program it use the command
<pre>
  make mica install.&lt;n&gt;
</pre>
where <em>&lt;n&gt;</em> is the local node ID that you wish to program
into the mote. For example,
<pre>
  make mica install.38
</pre>
programs the mote with ID 38.

<li>Program one mote with <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> and another with
<tt>RfmToLeds</tt>. When you turn on <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt>, you
