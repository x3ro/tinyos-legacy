This lesson demonstrates a simple sensor application that takes light
intensity readings (from the sensor board's photo sensor) and displays
those readings on the LEDs. This is based on the <tt>Sense</tt> application, 
found in <a href="../../apps/Sense"><tt>apps/Sense</tt></a>. This is a very simple application that reads
a value from the light sensor and displays the lower 3 bits of the value
on the LEDs. The application configuration is found in
<tt>Sense.nc</tt> and the implementation module in <tt>SenseM.ld</tt>.

<p>
Let's first look at the top portion of <tt>SenseM.nc</tt>:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>SenseM.nc</b>
<pre>
module SenseM {
  provides {
    interface StdControl;
  }
  uses {
    interface Timer;
    interface ADC;
    interface StdControl as ADCControl;
    interface Leds;
  }
}
// Implementation not shown ...
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Like <tt>BlinkM</tt>, this component provides the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface and requires <tt>Timer</tt> and <tt>Leds</tt>. It also
uses two new interfaces: <tt>ADC</tt>, which is used to access data
from the analogue-to-digital convertor, and <tt>StdControl</tt>,
which is used to initialize the ADC component. 

<p>
This application uses a new component, <tt>Timer</tt>, in place of
<tt>Clock</tt>. The reason is that <tt>Timer</tt> allows multiple
components to register to receive timer "tick" events at different
intervals, while <tt>Clock</tt> only provides a single global clock
that only one component can register to receive "tick" events from.
We'll demonstrate the use of the <tt>Timer</tt> interface a bit later.

<p>
Note the line
<pre>
  interface StdControl as ADCControl;
</pre>
This is saying that this component requires the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface but gives the <b>interface instance</b> the name
<tt>ADCControl</tt>. In this way a component can require multiple
instances of the same interface, but give them different names.
For example, a component might need to use the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface
to control both the ADC and the sounder components. In this case we
might say:
<pre>
  interface StdControl as ADCControl;
  interface StdControl as SounderControl;
</pre>
The configuration that uses this module will be responsible for wiring
each interface instance to some actual implementation.

<p>
One related note: if you don't provide an interface instance name then
the instance is named the same as the interface. That is, the line
<pre>
  interface ADC;
</pre>
is just shorthand for
<pre>
  interface ADC as ADC;
</pre>

<p>
Take a look at the <tt>StdControl</tt> and <tt>ADC</tt> interfaces
(both in <tt>tos/interfaces</tt>). You'll see that
<tt>StdControl</tt> is used to initialize and power a component
(usually a piece of physical hardware) and <tt>ADC</tt> is used to get
data from an ADC channel. <tt>ADC</tt> signals an event, 
<tt>dataReady()</tt>, when data is ready on the channel.

<p>
Going back to <tt>SenseM.nc</tt>, you'll see that the code simply 
calls <tt>ADC.getData()</tt> each time <tt>Timer.fired()</tt> is
signalled. Likewise, when <tt>ADC.dataReady()</tt> is signalled,
the internal function <tt>display()</tt> is invoked, which sets the LEDs
to the low-order bits of the ADC value. Easy!

<p>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
<td width="100%"><nobr><b><font

</tr></table>

<p>
In general you should always use <tt>Timer</tt> instead of 
<tt>Clock</tt> to receive tick events at regular intervals.
This is because <tt>Clock</tt> can only be used by a single
component in the system, while <tt>Timer</tt> allows multiple
components to receive timer events, potentially at different
intervals. <tt>Timer</tt> is also more flexible and easier to use.

<p>
Take a look at <tt>SenseM.td</tt> and it's use of the <tt>Timer</tt>
interface. To initialize the timer we call
<pre>
  call Timer.start(TIMER_REPEAT, 200);
</pre>
This indicates that the timer should repeatedly generate tick events
at a rate of once every 200 milliseconds (or 5 times a second). 
If you use <tt>TIMER_ONE_SHOT</tt> instead of <tt>TIMER_REPEAT</tt>,
the timer will fire just once. To stop the timer from firing, we call
<pre>
  call Timer.stop();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>Timer</tt> generates the event <tt>Timer.fired()</tt> whenevet it
goes off; looking at <tt>SenseM.td</tt> you'll see that the event
handler simply calls the command to take an ADC reading.

<p>

</tr></table>

<p>
At this point you should be wondering, "how does the <tt>Sense</tt>
application know that the ADC channel should access the light sensor?"
This is exactly what the <tt>Sense.nc</tt> configuration wires up for
us.

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>Sense.nc</b>
<pre>
configuration Sense {
  // this module does not provide any interface
}
implementation
{
  components Main, SenseM, LedsC, TimerC, Photo;

  Main.StdControl -> SenseM;

  SenseM.ADC -> Photo;
  SenseM.ADCControl -> Photo;
  SenseM.Leds -> LedsC;
  SenseM.Timer -> TimerC.Timer[unique("Timer")];
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Most of this should be familiar from <tt>Blink</tt>. We're wiring up the
<tt>Main.StdControl</tt> to <tt>SenseM.StdControl</tt>, as before. The
<tt>Leds</tt> wirings is also similar to <tt>Blink</tt>, and we'll discuss
<tt>Timer</tt> in a minute. The wiring for the ADC is:
<pre>
  SenseM.ADC -> Photo;
  SenseM.ADCControl -> Photo;
</pre>
All we're doing is wiring up the <tt>ADC</tt> interface (required by
<tt>SenseM</tt>) to a new component called <tt>Photo</tt>. Same goes for
the <tt>ADCControl</tt> interface, which you'll recall is an 
instance of the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface required by
<tt>SenseM</tt>. 

<p>
Remember that 
<pre>
  SenseM.ADC -> Photo;
</pre>
is just shorthand for
<pre>
  SenseM.ADC -> Photo.ADC;
</pre>
On the other hand,
<pre>
  SenseM.ADControl -> Photo;
</pre>
is <b>not shorthand</b> for
<pre>
  SenseM.ADC -> Photo.ADCControl;
</pre>

<p>
What's going on here?
If you look at the <tt>Photo.nc</tt> component (found in
<tt>tos/sensorboards/micasb</tt>), you'll see that it
provides both the <tt>ADC</tt> and <tt>StdControl</tt> interfaces --
it doesn't have an interface called <tt>ADCControl</tt>.
(<tt>ADCControl</tt> was just the name that we gave to the instance of
<tt>StdControl</tt> in the <tt>SenseM</tt> component.) 
Rather, the NesC compiler is smart enough to figure out that
because <tt>SenseM.ADCControl</tt> is <em>an instance of</em>
the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface, that it needs to be wired up to
<em>an instance of</em> the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface provided
by <tt>Photo</tt>. (If <tt>Photo</tt> were to provide two instances of
<tt>StdControl</tt>, this would be an error because the wiring would be
ambiguous.) In other words,
<pre>
  SenseM.ADControl -> Photo;
</pre>
is shorthand for
<pre>
  SenseM.ADControl -> Photo.StdControl;
</pre>
Whew!

<p>
Let's look at the line
<pre>
  SenseM.Timer -> TimerC.Timer[unique("Blink")];
</pre>
This is introducing a new bit of syntax, called a <b>parameterized
interface</b>.

<p>
A parameterized interface allows a component to provide
<em>multiple instances</em> of an interface that are parameterized
by a runtime or compile-time value. Recall that it's possible for a
component to provide multiple instances of an interface and to give
them different names, e.g.,
<pre>
  provides {
    interface StdControl as fooControl;
    interface StdControl as barControl;
  }
</pre>
This is just a generalization of the same idea. The <tt>TimerC</tt>
component declares:
<pre>
  provides interface Timer[uint8_t id];
</pre>
In other words, it provides 256 different instances of the
<tt>Timer</tt> interface, one for each <tt>uint8_t</tt> value!

<p>
In this case, we want TinyOS applications to create and use multiple
timers, each of which can be managed independently. For example, an
application component might need one timer to fire at a certain rate
(say, once per second) to gather sensor readings, while another 
component might need the a timer to fire at a different rate to manage radio
transmission. By wiring the <tt>Timer</tt> interface in each of
these components to a separate instance of the <tt>Timer</tt>
interface provided by <tt>TimerC</tt>, each component can effectively
get its own "private" timer.

<p>
When we say <tt>TimerC.Timer[someval]</tt>, we are specifying that
<tt>BlinkM.Timer</tt> should be wired to the instance of the
<tt>Timer</tt> interface specified by the value (<tt>someval</tt>) 
in the square brackets.
This can be any 8-bit number. If we were to specify a particular value
here, such as 38 or 42, we might accidentally conflict with the timer
being used by another component (if that component used the same value
in the brackets). So, we use the built-in function <tt>unique()</tt>,
which generates a unique 8-bit identifier from the string given as an
argument. Here,
<pre>
  unique("Timer")
</pre>
generates a unique 8-bit number from a set corresponding to the string
<tt>"Timer"</tt>. Therefore, Every component that uses 
<tt>unique("Timer")</tt>
is guaranteed to get a <em>different</em> 8-bit value as long as
the string used in the argument is the same. Note that if one component
uses <tt>unique("Timer")</tt> and another uses
<tt>unique("MyTimer")</tt>, they might get the <em>same</em> 8-bit
value. Therefore it's good practice to use the name of the parameterized
interface as an argument to the <tt>unique()</tt> function.

<p>
As before, just do a <tt>make mica install</tt> in the <tt>Sense</tt>
directory to compile and install the application on your mote. You'll
need a sensor board attached to the mote with a photo sensor. The type of
sensorboard is selected by the <tt>-board</tt> command line option to 
<tt>ncc</tt>. On the Mica mote, the default sensor 
board type is <tt>micasb</tt>. However, if you have an older ("basic")
sensor board, you might need to pass in the <tt>-board basicsb</tt>
option to <tt>ncc</tt>. To do this, edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> in the
<tt>Sensor</tt> directory and add the line
<tt>
  SENSORBOARD = basicsb
</tt> 
before the line that includes <tt>Makerules</tt>.

<p>
The operation of the photo sensor is a little funny. 
The ADC yields a 10-bit digitized sample of the
photo sensor. What we would like is for the LEDs to be off when the node
is in the light, and on when the node is in the dark. Here, we are 
looking at the upper three bits of this data coming from the ADC, and 
inverting the value. Note the line:
<pre>
  display(7 - ((data >> 7) & 0x7));
</pre>
in the <tt>ADC.dataReady()</tt> function of <tt>SenseM</tt>.

<p>
Note that when running the application you may really have to cover up
the photo sensor pretty well to get it to respond - we'll admit that this
is not the best application to really see the photo sensor at work!

<p>
Extend the capability of the application by chirping the sensor
board's sounder when it is dark! The TinyOS component for the Sounder is
located in <tt>tos/sensorboards/micasb/Sounder.nc</tt>. To make
the sounder turn on, call the <tt>StdControl.power()</tt> command of the
<tt>Sounder</tt> component's <tt>StdControl</tt> interface, using the
argument <tt>POWER_ON</tt>. To turn off the sounder, call
<tt>StdControl.power(POWER_OFF)</tt>. You will need to include the line
<pre>
  includes sensorboard;
</pre>
at the top of your module in order to pick up the macro definitions for
<tt>POWER_ON</tt> and <tt>POWER_OFF</tt>. Be sure to test this new application 
many times to annoy everyone sitting around you.
