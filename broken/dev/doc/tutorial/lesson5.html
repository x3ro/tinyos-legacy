    <p>Nido, the TinyOS simulator, compiles directly from TinyOS
    code. Built with <tt>make pc</tt>, the simulation runs natively
    on a desktop or laptop. Nido can simulate thousands of nodes
    simultaneously. Every mote in a simulation runs the same TinyOS
    program.</p>
      
    <p>Nido provides run-time configurable debugging output, allowing
    a user to examine the execution of an application from different
    perspectives without needing to recompile. The simulation provides
    several mechanisms for interacting with the network; packet
    traffic can be monitored, packets can be statically or dynamically
    injected into the network. In this lesson, we won't be dealing
    with packet injection, which is discussed in <a
    href="lesson9.html">Lesson 9</a> </p>

	      </b></td> </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Nido is compiled by typing <tt>make pc</tt> in an application
      directory. In addition to the expected TinyOS components, a few
      simulator-specific files are compiled; these files provide
      functionality such as support for networking monitoring over TCP
      sockets.</p>
      
      <p>Enter the <a
      href="../../apps/CntToLedsAndRfm"><tt>apps/CntToLedsAndRfm</tt></a>
      directory. This application runs a 4Hz counter. On each counter
      tick, the application displays the least significant three bits
      of the counter on the mote LEDs and sends the entire 16-bit
      value in a packet. Build and install the application on a
      mote. You should see the LEDs blink; if you listen with a
      GenericBase mote, you should see messages of AM type 4 with an
      incrementing counter in the payload.</p>
      
      <p>Build a Nido version of the application with <tt>make
      pc</tt>. The Nido executable is <tt>build/pc/main.exe</tt>. Type
      <tt>build/pc/main.exe --help</tt> to see a brief summary of its
      command-line usage. Nido has a single required parameter, the
      number of nodes to simulate. Type <tt>build/pc/main.exe 1</tt>
      to run a simulation of a single node.</p>
      
      <p>You should see a long stream of output fly by, most of which
      refer to radio bit events. Hit control-C to stop the
      simulation. If you look, almost every message is preceded by a
      <tt>0:</tt>; this means that the message pertains to the
      execution of mote 0. Run a simulation of two motes
      (<tt>build/pc/main.exe 2</tt>); after it runs for a few seconds,
      stop the simulation with control-C. You should see messages for
      both mote 0 and mote 1.</p>

      <p>By default, Nido prints out all debugging information. As
      radio bit events are fired at 20 or 40 KHz, these are the most
      frequent events in the simulator, they comprise most of the
      output in CntToLedsAndRfm. Given the application, we're more
      concerned with the packet output and mote LEDs than individual
      radio bits. Nido output can be configured by setting the
      <tt>DBG</tt> environment variable in a shell. Type <tt>export
      DBG=am,led</tt> in your shell; this makes only LED and AM packet
      output enabled. Run a one-mote simulation. You should see output
      similar to this:</p>

      <p>The sixth byte of the packet contains the least significant
      byte of the two byte counter; in the first packet, it's hex 0x20
      (32), in the second, it's hex 0x21 (33). As the LEDs show the
      bottom three bits of the counter, they are all off for the first
      packet and bit one is on for the second.</p>

      <p>The full set of DBG modes can be seen by typing
      <tt>build/pc/main.exe --help</tt>; they are listed at the bottom
      of the output. For example:</p>
	
	<center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">

      </table>

      <p>Set <tt>DBG</tt> to <tt>crc</tt>. Run two mote imulation of
      CntToLedsAndRfm. You should see output indicating that both
      nodes are successfully receiving packets from each-other.</p>

      <p>Four DBG modes are reserved for application components and
      debugging use: <tt>usr1</tt>, <tt>usr2</tt>, <tt>usr3</tt>, and
      <tt>temp</tt>. In TinyOS code, debug message commands have this
      syntax:</p>

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre>dbg(&lt;mode&gt;, const char* format, ...);</pre>
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>
      
      <p>The mode parameter specifies which under which DBG modes this
      message will be printed. The full set of modes can be found in
      <tt>tos/system/dbg_modes.h</tt>. The format and following
      parameters specify the string to output and have printf()
      semantics. For example, open <tt>tos/lib/Counter.td</tt> in your
      editor. In <tt>Clock.fire()</tt>, add this line just before the
      return statement:</p>
	
      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre>dbg(DBG_TEMP, "Counter: Value is %i\n", (int)state);</pre>
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>

      <p>Set <tt>DBG</tt> to be <tt>temp</tt> and run a single mote
      simulation. You'll see the counter increment. In general, the
      DBG mode name in TinyOS code is the name used when you run the
      simulator, with <tt>DBG_</tt>prepended. For example, <tt>am</tt>
      is <tt>DBG_AM</tt>, <tt>packet</tt> is <tt>DBG_PACKET</tt> and
      <tt>boot</tt> is <tt>DBG_BOOT</tt>.</p>

      <p>Just as you can enable multiple modes when running the
      simulator, a single debug message can be activated on multiple
      modes. Each mode is a bit in a large bitmask; one can use all of
      the standard logical operators (e.g. <tt>|</tt>,
      <tt>~</tt>) . For example, change the debug message you just
      added to:</p>

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre>dbg(DBG_TEMP|DBG_USR1, "Counter: Value is %i\n", (int)state);</pre>
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>

      <p>It will now be printed if either <tt>temp</tt> or
      <tt>usr1</tt> is enabled. Run the application to see this is the
      case..</p>

      <p>Open another shell and go to the <tt>tools/java</tt>
      directory.</p>
      
      <p>Run a four mote simulation of <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> in
      your original shell. Go back the shell in which you compiled the
      Java tools and run <tt>SimGUI</tt> (this order is important):</p>

	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>
      
      <p>You should see the packets from the different motes in the
      window, something like this:</p>
	
      <p><img src="imgs/SimGUI.gif"></img></p>
      
      <p>The checkboxes on the left side of the GUI enable or disable
      visualization of output from motes; the "Clear All" and "Select
      All" buttons refer to these selections. You can click on a
      specific packet to display a small window showing the entire
      message payload. Clicking the "Pause" button will pause the
      simulation and its output.</p>

      <p>Quit the SimGUI.</p>
      
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
	  <td width="100%"><nobr> <b>

	      </b></td> </tr>

      </table>

      
      <p>One significant advantage of Nido is that, because it runs
      natively on a PC, you can use traditional debugging tools such
      as <tt>gdb</tt>. However, because Nido is a discrete event
      simulation for large numbers of motes, traditional step-through
      debugging techniques only work on an event basis, and not
      cross-events.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, <tt>gdb</tt> is generally designed for C and
      not nesC; the component model of nesC means that a single
      command can have multiple providers; referring to a specific
      command requries specifying the component, interface, and
      command. For example, to break on entry to the <tt>redOff</tt>
      command of the <tt>Leds</tt> interface of <tt>LedsC</tt>, one
      must type:</p>

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre><tt>
(gdb) break *LedsC$Leds$redOff
Breakpoint 1 at 0x804c644: file tos/system/LedsC.td, line 97.</tt></pre>
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>

      <p>The leading * is necessary so <tt>gdb</tt> can parse the
      function name correctly; otherwise, it looks for the function
      <tt>LedsC</tt>.</p>

      <p>Variables are similarly named. For example, to print the
      <tt>ledsOn</tt> variable of <tt>LedsC</tt> (which keeps track of
      on/off for the toggle commands), one types:</p>

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre><tt>
(gdb) print LedsC$LedsOn
$3 = '\0' &lt;repeats 999 times&gt;
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>

      <p>Actually, this isn't quite correct, as the output above shows;
      in Nido, <tt>ledsOn</tt> isn't a single <tt>uint8_t</tt>, but an
      array of 1000 of them. This is how Nido handles the state of
      many motes; it compiles fields to be arrays of <i>n</i>
      elements, where <i>n</i> is the maximum simulation
      size. Whenever a mote accesses a component's state, it indexes
      into the array based on its node ID. Therefore, to refer to a
      specific mote's state, one needs to index into the array
      properly:</p>

<center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre><tt>
(gdb) print LedsC$ledsOn[tos_state.current_node]
$2 = 0 '\0'
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>

      <p>We've supplied a simple <tt>gdb</tt> macro named <tt>VAR</tt>
      that handles this for you. Copy
      <tt>tos/platform/pc/.gdbinit</tt> to your home directory (if
      there's already a <tt>.gdbinit</tt> there, just append this
      file). Quit <tt>gdb</tt> and start it again. Break in
      <tt>LedsC$Leds$redOff</tt> as before. Now, instead of the above
      command line, you can type:</p>

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <pre><tt>
(gdb) VAR LedsC$ledsOn
$3 = 0 '\0'
	    </td></tr></table>
      </center>

      
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>

      </table>

      <p>This tutorial only covers some of the functionality and
      usefulness of Nido; for example, as Nido simulates the TinyOS
      networking stack at bit granularity, radio models can accurately
      simulate difficult issues that arise, such as the hidden node
      problem. Similarly, one can test and debug low-level protocols
      (such as start symbol detection) in addition to application
      components and routing protocols. The <a href="../nido.pdf">Nido
      System Description</a> goes into greater details on these
      capabilities and presents some information on Nido's
      implementation.</p>
