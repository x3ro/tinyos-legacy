This lesson introduces the basic concepts of TinyOS and the NesC
language in which the system is written.
It includes a quick overview of the NesC language concepts and
syntax to help you get started with programming in this environment.

<p>
The TinyOS system, libraries, and applications are written in NesC, a
new language for programming structured component-based applications.
The NesC language is primarily intended for embedded systems such as
sensor networks. NesC has a C-like syntax, but introduces a number of
novel concepts for structuring, naming, and linking together
software components. The principal goal is to allow application designers to
build components that can be easily linked together,
and yet detect component linkage errors at compile time.

<p>
NesC defines a number of important concepts:

<dl>

<dt><b>Application</b></dt>
<dd> A NesC <b>application</b> consists of one or more 
<b>components</b>, linked together to form a runnable executable.

<p>
<dt><b>Component</b></dt>
<dd> <b>Components</b> are the basic building blocks for NesC
applications. Components are of two types: <b>modules</b> and
<b>configurations</b>. 
</dd>

<p>
<dt><b>Module</b></dt>
<dd> A <b>module</b> is a NesC component consisting of
application code in a C-like syntax.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><b>Configuration</b></dt>
<dd> A <b>configuration</b> is a component that "wires" other
components together. The idea here is that one can build an application
as a set of modules, wiring together those modules by providing a
configuration. Every NesC application has a single <b>top-level
configuration</b> that specifies the set of components in the
application and how they invoke one another.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><b>Interface</b></dt>
<dd>
An interface is used to provide an abstract definition of the
interaction of two components (the user and the provider). 
Similar to languages such as Java, an interface contains no actual code 
or wiring; it simply declares a set of functions that the interface's 
provider must implement (called <b>commands</b>), and another set of 
functions the interface's requirer must implement (called <b>events</b>). 
In this way it is different than Java interfaces. A Java interface 
specifies one direction of call, while NesC interfaces specify 
two directions.	For a component to call the commands in an  
interface, it must implement the events of that interface 
A single component may require or provide multiple interfaces and multiple
instances of the same interface. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
NesC uses the filename extension "<tt>.nc</tt>" for all source files --
interfaces, modules, and configurations. Please see <a href="./naming.html">
TinyOS Coding and Naming Conventions</a> for more information on naming conventions.

<p>
So far this is all fairly abstract - let's look at a concrete example:
the simple test program "Blink" found in <a
href="../../apps/Blink"><tt>apps/Blink</tt></a> in the TinyOS
tree. This application simply causes the red LED on the mote to turn
on and off at 1Hz.

<p>
Blink consists of two <b>components</b>: a <b>module</b>, called
"<tt>BlinkM.nc</tt>", and a <b>configuration</b>, called
"<tt>Blink.nc</tt>". Remember that all applications require a single
top-level configuration, which is typically named after the
application itself. In this case <tt>Blink.nc</tt> is the
configuration for the Blink application and the source file that the
NesC compiler uses to generate the executable for the
mote. <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt>, on the other hand, actually provides the
<em>implementation</em> of the Blink application. As you might guess,
<tt>Blink.nc</tt> is used to wire the <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt> module to
other components that the Blink application requires.

<p>
The reason for the distinction between modules and configurations is to
allow a system designer to quickly "snap together" applications. For
example, a designer could provide a configuration that simply wires
together one or more modules, none of which she actually designed.
Likewise, another developer can provide a new set of "library" modules 
that can be used in a range of applications. 

<p> 
Sometimes (as is the case with <tt>Blink</tt> and <tt>BlinkM</tt>) 
you will have a configuration and a module that go together. 
When this is the case, the convention used in the TinyOS tree is that
<tt>Foo.nc</tt> represents a configuration and <tt>FooM.nc</tt>
represents the corresponding module. While you could name an
application's implementation module and associated top-level
configuration anything (ncc uses the 'COMPONENT'
definition in the application's Makefile to find the top-level
configuration), to keep things simple we suggest that you adopt this
convention in your own code. There are several other naming conventions 
used in TinyOS code; a <a href="naming.html">summary</a> is provided

<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
<td width="100%"><nobr><b><font
face="arial,helvetica">The BlinkM.nc module</font></b></nobr></td>
</tr></table>

<p>
Let's look first at the module <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt>:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>BlinkM.nc</b>
<pre>
module BlinkM {
  provides {
    interface StdControl;
  }
  uses {
    interface Clock;
    interface Leds;
  }
}
// Continued below...
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
The first part of the code states that this is a module called
<tt>BlinkM</tt>. <tt>BlinkM</tt> <b>provides</b> an interface
called <tt>StdControl</tt>, and <b>uses</b> two interfaces:
<tt>Clock</tt> and <tt>Leds</tt>.

<p>
The idea of providing and requiring interfaces should be familiar to
anyone who has programmed in an object-oriented language such as Java.
First consider the clause 
"<tt>provides interface StdControl</tt>". This means that
<tt>BlinkM</tt> implements the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface.
<tt>StdControl</tt> is a common interface used to initialize and
start TinyOS components. If we look at
<tt>tos/interfaces/StdControl.nc</tt>:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>StdControl.nc</b>
<pre>
interface StdControl {
  command result_t init();
  command result_t start();
  command result_t stop();
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
We see that <tt>StdControl</tt> defines three <b>commands</b>,
<tt>init()</tt>, <tt>start()</tt>, and <tt>stop()</tt>. 
<tt>init()</tt> is called when a
component is first initialized, and <tt>start()</tt> when it is started,
that is, actually executed for the first time. 
<tt>stop()</tt> is called when the component is stopped, for example, in
order to power off the device that it is controlling.
<tt>init()</tt> can be called multiple times, but will never be called 
after either <tt>start()</tt> or <tt>stop</tt> are called.
Specifically, the valid call patterns of StdControl are <tt>init* (start | stop)*</tt> 
All three of these commands have "deep" semantics; calling <tt>init()</tt> 
on a component will make it call <tt>init()</tt> on all of its subcomponents. 
A good example is the component controlling the mote radio:
<tt>init()</tt> is called when the component is initialized, 
<tt>start()</tt> is called to enable power to the radio, and 
<tt>stop()</tt> to shut off power. Because the radio power is only
needed when communicating, <tt>start()</tt> and <tt>stop()</tt> may be
called multiple times to power on or power off the radio.

<p>
A <b>command</b> is just a function that may be defined in an interface.
If an interface defines a command, then any component that
<b>provides</b> that interface must implement that function.
In the case of <tt>BlinkM</tt>, then, we expect this module to
implement the <tt>init()</tt>, <tt>start()</tt>, and <tt>stop()</tt> 
commands, which it does as we will see below.

<p>
Likewise, if an interface defines a command, then any component
that <b>uses</b> that interface may call the function.
<tt>BlinkM</tt> uses two interfaces, <tt>Clock</tt> and
<tt>Leds</tt>. (The code for these can be found in 
<tt>tos/interfaces</tt>.) 
For example, <tt>Leds.nc</tt> defines a bunch of commands like
<tt>redOn()</tt>, <tt>redOff()</tt>, and so forth, which turn the
different LEDs (red, green, or yellow) on the mote on and off.
Because <tt>BlinkM</tt> uses the <tt>Leds</tt> interface, it can
invoke any of these commands. (Keep in mind, however, that <tt>Leds</tt>
is just an interface: it specifies no implementation. We will see
later how the configuration, <tt>Blink.nc</tt>, is used to wire 
<tt>BlinkM</tt>'s use of the <tt>Leds</tt> interface to a concrete
implementation of that interface.)

<p>
<tt>Clock.nc</tt> is a little more interesting:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>Clock.nc</b>
<pre>
interface Clock {
  command result_t setRate(char interval, char scale);
  event result_t fire();
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Here we see that <tt>Clock</tt> defines the <tt>setRate()</tt> command,
which is used to specify the rate at which the clock will tick.
However, we see something new here:
<pre>
  event result_t fire();
</pre>
An <b>event</b> is a function that the implementation of an interface
will invoke when a certain event takes place. In this case,
the <tt>fire()</tt> event is invoked when the clock tick goes off.
This is an example of a <b>bi-directional interface</b>: an interface
not only provides <b>commands</b> that can be invoked <em>by users</em> of the 
interface, but also generates <b>events</b> that invoke functions 
<em>in the user</em>.
Think of an event as a callback function that the implementation of an
interface will invoke. A module that <b>uses</b> an interface
<em>must implement the events</em> that this interface uses. 

<p>
Let's look at the rest of <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt> to see how this all fits
together:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>BlinkM.nc, continued</b>
<pre>
implementation {
  bool state;

  command result_t StdControl.init() {
    state = FALSE;
    return SUCCESS;
  }

  command result_t StdControl.start() {
    return call Clock.setRate(TOS_I1PS, TOS_S1PS);
  }

  command result_t StdControl.stop() {
    return call Clock.setRate(TOS_I0PS, TOS_S0PS);
  }

  event result_t Clock.fire()
  {
    state = !state;

    if (state) 
      call Leds.redOn();
    else
      call Leds.redOff();

    return SUCCESS;
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
This is simple enough. As we see the <tt>BlinkM</tt> module implements
the <tt>StdControl.init()</tt>, 
<tt>StdControl.start()</tt>, and <tt>StdControl.stop()</tt> commands,
since it provides the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface. It also implements
the <tt>Clock.fire()</tt> event, which is necessary since
<tt>BlinkM</tt> uses the <tt>Clock</tt> interface. 

<p>
<tt>init()</tt> simply initializes the internal state of the module,
and <tt>start()</tt> invokes <tt>Clock.setRate()</tt> to set the clock
rate to 1 tick per second. <tt>stop()</tt> sets the clock rate to 
zero ticks per second, which is equivalent to disabling the clock.
Each time <tt>fire()</tt> is invoked, the <tt>state</tt> boolean is toggled
and the LEDs set appropriately. Voila!

<p>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
<td width="100%"><nobr><b><font

</tr></table>

<p>
Now let's look at <tt>Blink.nc</tt>, the configuration for this
application:

<p>
<center>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%">
<b>BlinkM.nc, continued</b>
<pre>
configuration Blink {
}
implementation {
  components Main, BlinkM, ClockC, LedsC;

  Main.StdControl -> BlinkM.StdControl;
  BlinkM.Clock -> ClockC;
  BlinkM.Leds -> LedsC;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
The first thing to notice is that the syntax of a configuration is
slightly different, in that it doesn't contain any code.
The first two lines, 
<pre>
  configuration Blink {
  }
</pre>
simply state that this is a configuration called <tt>Blink</tt>. Within
the empty braces here it is possible to specify <tt>require</tt> and
<tt>provides</tt> clauses, as with a module. This is important to keep
in mind: a configuration can require and provide interfaces! 

<p>
The "<tt>components</tt>" line specifies the set of components that this
configuration references, in this case <tt>Main</tt>, <tt>BlinkM</tt>,
<tt>Clock</tt>, and <tt>Leds</tt>. 
In many ways this line is redundant since it's obvious from the rest of
the file which components are referenced by the configuration. 
The <tt>components</tt> line is included only for completeness, but is
required by the NesC compiler. 

<p> 
<tt>Main</tt> is the "main" component 
used by all NesC applications, which is simply used to initialize the
application through the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface. 
The right arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>) is used to "wire" the use of an
interface to an implementation of that interface. The line:
<pre>
  Main.StdControl -> BlinkM.StdControl;
</pre>
is used to wire the use of the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface in 
<tt>Main</tt> to the implementation of the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface in <tt>BlinkM</tt>. Think of the right arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>)
as "binds to". On the left of the arrow is a component that 
<b>uses</b> an interface, and on the right of the arrow is a
 component that <b>provides</b> that interface.

<p>
Likewise, the lines
<pre>
  BlinkM.Clock -> ClockC;
  BlinkM.Leds -> LedsC;
</pre>
are used to bind the use of the <tt>Clock</tt> and <tt>Leds</tt>
interfaces in <tt>BlinkM</tt> to their respective implementations.

<p>
There are two confusing things about these lines. First of all, 
the <tt>Clock</tt> on the left side of the arrow is referring
to the <em>interface</em> called <tt>Clock</tt>
(<tt>tos/interfaces/Clock.nc</tt>), while the <tt>ClockC</tt>
on the right side of the arrow is refering to
the <em>implementation module</em> called <tt>ClockC</tt>, found in
<tt>tos/system/Clock.nc</tt>. Remember that the arrow always binds
interfaces (on the left) to implementations (on the right).
<tt>ClockC</tt> is a mnemonic for "clock component".

<p> 
The second confusing point is that the line
<pre>
  BlinkM.Clock -> ClockC;
</pre>
is really shorthand for
<pre>
  BlinkM.Clock -> ClockC.Clock;
</pre>
That is, because <tt>BlinkM</tt> is using the interface <tt>Clock.nc</tt>,
we are trying to bind it to an implementation (in the module
<tt>ClockC.nc</tt>) of the same interface.
If no interface name is given on the right side of the arrow, the NesC 
compiler tries to bind to the same interface as on the left side of 
the arrow.

<p>
Likewise, the line
<pre>
  Main.StdControl -> BlinkM.StdControl;
</pre>
could have been written
<pre>
  Main.StdControl -> BlinkM;
</pre>
for brevity.

<p>
If you are in the TinyOS source tree, compiling the <tt>Blink</tt>
application is as simple as typing
<pre>
  make mica
</pre>
in the <a href="../../apps/Blink"><tt>apps/Blink</tt></a>
directory. Of course this doesn't tell you anything about how the NesC
compiler is invoked.

<p>
NesC itself is invoked using the <tt>ncc</tt> command which is based on
<tt>gcc</tt>. For example, you can type
<pre>
  ncc -o main.exe -target=mica Blink.nc 
</pre>
to compile the <tt>Blink</tt> application (from the <tt>Blink.nc</tt>
top-level configuration) to <tt>main.exe</tt>, an executable file for
the Mica mote. To actually upload the code to the mote, you use
<pre>
  avr-objcopy --output-target=srec main.exe main.srec
</pre>
to produce <tt>main.srec</tt>, which essentially represents the binary 
<tt>main.exe</tt> file in a text format that can be used for programming
the mote. You then use another tool (such as <tt>uisp</tt>) to actually
upload the code to the mote, depending on your environment.

In general you will never need to invoke <tt>ncc</tt> or <tt>avr-objcopy</tt> 
by hand, but it's nice to see that all you need to compile a NesC
application is to run <tt>ncc</tt> on the top-level configuration file
for your app. <tt>ncc</tt> takes care of locating and compiling all of
the different components required by your application, linking them
together, and ensuring that all of the component wiring matches up.

<p>
Now that we've compiled the application it's time to program the mote
and run it. To download your program into the mote, place the
mote board (or mote and sensor stack) into the bay on the programming
board, as shown below. You can either supply a 3 volt supply to the
connector on the programming board or power the node directly. The red
LED (labeled D2) on the programming board will be on when power is
supplied. If you are using batteries to power the mote, be sure the mote
is switched on (the power switch should be towards the connector).

<p>
Plug the 32-pin connector into the parallel port of a
computer configured with the TOS tools, using a standard 
DB32 parallel port cable.

  pulse
  An error has occurred during the AVR initialization.
   * Target status:
      Vendor Code = 0xff, Part Family = 0xff, Part Number = 0xff

  Probably the wiring is incorrect or target might be `damaged'.
  make: *** [install] Error 2
</pre>
check whether the power is on. You can also get this error message if
the mote is low on batteries (if you are using batteries), or if the
wrong version of the <tt>uisp</tt> programming utility is installed
(be sure to use the version in the NEST distribution).

<p>
If you are using an IBM ThinkPad, it may be necessary to tell the tools
to use a different parallel port. You can do this by adding the
line 
<pre>
  HOST = THINKPAD
</pre>
before the <tt>include</tt> statement in <a href="../../apps/Blink/Makefile"><tt>apps/Blink/Makefile</tt></a>.

<p>
If the installation is successful you should see something like the
following:

<p>
You can now test the program by unplugging the mote from the programming
board and turning on the power switch (if it's not already on). With any
luck the red LED should light up every second - congratulations!

Typing <tt>make clean</tt> in the <tt>Blink</tt> directory will clean up

This tutorial has just scratched the surface of NesC's syntax and
features. Rather than document everything extensively, we 
refer the reader to the 
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/nescc/">NesC Project
Pages</a> which should contain more complete documentation on the
language. Hopefully this should be enough of a start to get you going on
