In this lesson, you will learn to use the TinyDB query processing system for 
extracting data from motes through a declarative query interface that is similar
to the SQL interface of a relational database system.  This lesson assumes you have a 
familiarity with the TinyOS toolset (have completed through lesson 7), but
will not require you to write (or even look at!) any C code.

TinyDB is a query processing system for extracting
information from a network of
motes. Unlike other
solutions for data processing in TinyOS,
TinyDB does not require you to write embedded C
code for sensors.
Instead, TinyDB provides a
simple, SQL-like interface to specify the data you want to
extract, along with additional parameters, like the rate at which data
should be refreshed -- much as you would pose queries against a
traditional database.  
Given a query specifying your data interests,
TinyDB collects that data from motes in the
environment, filters it, aggregates it together, and routes it out to
a PC.  TinyDB does this via power-efficient in-network
processing algorithms.<p>

To use TinyDB, you install its TinyOS components onto
each mote in your sensor network. 
TinyDB provides a simple
Java API for writing PC applications that query and extract data from
the network; it also comes with a simple graphical query-builder and
result display that uses the API.<p>

The primary goal of TinyDB is to make your life as a programmer
significantly easier, and allow data-driven applications to be
developed and deployed <i>much</i> more quickly than what is currently
possible.  TinyDB frees you from the burden of writing low-level code
for sensor devices, including the (very tricky) sensor network
interfaces.

For this lesson, you will need three motes.  Program all three with the <code>TinyDBApp</code> application, setting their id's to 0, 1, and 2.  Turn on all three and connect the mote you programmed with id 0 to the PC serial port.
<p>
You will interact with these motes using the <code>TinyDBMain</code> class in
<code>tools/java/net/tinyos/tinydb</code>.  First, you need to build the
java classes -- to do this, you need to insure that several packages are in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>. The packages you need are <code>JLex.jar</code>, <code>cup.jar</code>, and <code>plot.jar</code>;  all three are available in 
<code>tools/java/jars</code>. You'll need to set your <code>CLASSPATH</code>
variable in your shell -- under bash, this would look like:

<blockquote>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%"><pre>
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:<i>/path/to/tinyos</i>/tools/java/jars/plot.jar:\
    <i>/path/to/tinyos</i>/tools/java/jars/JLex.jar:\
    <i>/path/to/tinyos</i>/tools/java/jars/cup.jar
</pre></td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

Under <code>sh</code> or <code>csh</code> you would write "<code>setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH:...</code>"  instead of "<code>export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:...</code>".
<p>
Now, build the java classes by typing <code>make</code> in the <code>tools/java/net/tinyos/tinydb</code> directory. This may take several minutes and will output lots of text as the TinyDB query parser is compiled.
<p>
Finally, you're ready to start up the GUI!  Type <code>java net.tinyos.tinydb.TinyDBMain</code> from the <code>tools/java</code> directory.  The TinyDB GUI should appear:<p>

<img src="imgs/tinydb-main.jpg"></img>
<p>
To specify a query in this GUI, you move the fields you want to extract from the
sensors from the list of available attributes on the left to the list of
projected attributes on the right. Let's add the light attribute:  first, click
on "light" in the left column, then click the ">>>" button.  You display
should now look like:
<p>
<img src="imgs/tinydb-light.jpg"></img>
<p>
Notice that the text of the query below the attribute list updates as
you modify the query.  The <code>SAMPLE PERIOD</code> clause in the query
specifies that a new light reading will be delivered once every 1024 milliseconds.
You can change the sample period using the pop-up menu at the top of
the window.
<p>
Now let's add the nodeid attribute:  click on "nodeid" in the left column, and then
click the ">>>" button again.  Your display should now look like:
<p>
<img src="imgs/tinydb-light_and_id.jpg"></img>
<p>

Unlike light, nodeid does not specify a 
physical sensor reading, but instead is the id that was programmed into the
mote using the <code>make mica install.nodeid</code> command.  You'll learn
later how to extend TinyDB with other attributes of your own creation.

Now, we're ready to run a query.  Click the "Send Query" button;  a result
window will appear:
<p>
<img src="imgs/tinydb-result1.jpg"></img>
<p>
As this window appears, 
the red LED on mote id 0 (the <i>basestation</i>) should blink a few
times, and shortly thereafter the red LEDS on motes 1 and 2 should
turn on.  After a few seconds, the yellow LEDS on all three motes
should blink about once a second -- this indicates the query is
running properly.  If the LEDs don't start blinking in a few seconds,
try clicking "Resend Query" to reissue the query.
<p>
Results should now be streaming into the GUI, showing the light reading
at motes 1 and 2.  Try covering mote 2;  you should see the
line representing its value on the graph fall off:
<p>

<p>
That's it for this simple introduction to TinyDB.  In the next section, we will 
discuss the more sophisticated features of TinyDB that make it useful in a 
broad range of data collection applications.



    <p>
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
	  <td width="100%"><nobr> <b> <font
	  face="arial,helvetica">Neat, But What Else Is It Good For?</font> </b></td>
	</tr> </table></p>

TinyDB includes a number of other features.  See the "Where To Look For More Information"
section for a link to the complete TinyDB reference manual.  In this section, we'll briefly
describe other features of the query language.
<p>
<b> The WHERE clause </b>:

TinyDB queries can contain a <code>WHERE</code> clause that filters out particular readings that
are not of interest.  For example, a query that finds the light and temperature readings and id's
of all motes whose light reading is
above 400 would look like:

<blockquote>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="50%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%"><pre>
SELECT nodeid,light,temp 
FROM sensors
WHERE light > 400
SAMPLE PERIOD 1024
</pre></td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

To create such a query, use the "New Predicate" button to add a predicate, select "light" from
the predicate attribute menu, select ">" from the menu of comparative operators, and type 400 
into the value field:
<p>
<img src="imgs/tinydb-where.jpg"></img>
<p>
Note that you can use a <code>WHERE</code> clause over nodeid to send queries
to only a subset of the network.  
<p>
<b> Aggregation Predicates </b>:
TinyDB also allows you to compute <i>aggregates</i> over readings being reported by
several nodes in a query.  For example, to compute the average temperature reading of all
the sensors where the light is above 400, you would issue the query:
<blockquote>
<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="50%" cellpadding=3>
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
<td width="100%"><pre>
SELECT AVG(temp)
FROM sensors
WHERE light > 400
SAMPLE PERIOD 1024
</pre></td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<p>
To specify this query, select "AVG" in the aggregation operator menu before moving
temp into the projected attributes list:
<p>
<img src="imgs/tinydb-aggr.jpg"></img>
<p>
TinyDB computes this query via an efficient <i>in-network</i> approach, where sensors
aggregate their own readings with readings from their neighbors and forward those
aggregate values towards to basestation.
<p>
You've now seen how to pose a simple query with filtration and aggregation predicates.
In the next section, you'll learn how to extend TinyDB with new attributes that can be queried
via the same standardized interface.
