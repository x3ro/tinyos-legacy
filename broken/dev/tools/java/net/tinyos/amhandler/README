Package: net.tinyos.amhandler
Description: Classes to export an AM-like interface up to java
Author: Sam Madden (madden@cs.berkeley.edu)

These classes export an AM-like interface into java.  By extending AMHandler,
a java program can receive notification amout messages received over the
UART via a generic base mote.  AMInterface allows active-messages to be
sent over the UART via a generic base.  CRC is supported.

These classes are utility classes used by the schema and calibrate packages,
and in the IDF demo and are (yet another) way to access the serial port
independently of SerialForwarder.

Executables: none

Test Programs: AMTest

net.tinyos.amhandler.AMTest
        usage: java net.tinyos.amhandler.AMTest
        descr: Test the AMInterface by repeatedly sending out
		requests for database motes to report their
	        schemas, and printing those schemas out when they 
	        arrive.

Classes:

AMInterface.java

The core class.  Receives messages from the UART, multiplexes them
to the java classes which have called registerHandler for that 
particular AM id.  Allows motes to send active messages via the
sendAM method.  Will compute CRCs for outgoing messages if the "crc"
flag is set to true in the constructor. 

Uses javax.comm to interface to the serial port (not SerialForwarder!)

AMHandler.java

Interface which classes must implement iof they wish to use the
registerHandler mechanism for accepting messages.
