ForwarderListen.java:

A simple utility that connects to the SerialForwarder and displays
the resulting packet stream on the screen as a series of white space
delimited hex bytes.

arrive. This interface is used by SerialStub to notify when data comes
in over a serial connection.

Implementation of SerialStub that communicates with SerialForwarder as
if it were a serial port; allows for multiplexing of serial streams on
the actual port.

SerialPortStub.java:

Implementation of SerialStub that communicates over a serial port
using the javax.comm API.

SerialStub.java:
