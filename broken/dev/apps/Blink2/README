README for Blink2
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

Blink2 is a basic application that toggles the leds on the mote
on every clock interrupt.  The difference between Blink and Blink2
is how the Clock.fire() event is handled.  Blink2 offloads processing
to a task which controls the LEDs.  Blink controls the LEDs directly
in the event handler thereby not returning from the event until the
LEDs have been toggled.  The clock interrupt is scheduled to
occur every second.  The initialization of the clock can be seen
in the Blink initialization function, StdControl.start().
