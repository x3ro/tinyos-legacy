Description:

TestBombilla is a test application for Bombilla, the TinyOS
communication-centric bytecode interpreter. It includes the VM and all
of its subcomponents. Installing this application on a mote will
install Bombilla, which by default has a program similar to
CntToLedsAndRFM. new programs can be installed on motes over the
network. A Bombilla tutorial and reference are provided in the TinyOS
release, outlining its capabilities and uses.

Tools:

net.tinyos.bombilla.ProgramInjector

This class interfaces to SerialForward. Users type assembly-style
Bombilla programs into the GUI, which are then translated into
bytecodes and injected into the network.

Known bugs/limitations:

ProgramInjector is not yet written.
