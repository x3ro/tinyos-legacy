Description:

ExternalFunction is an application that collects different
functionalities of a mote into a single command/execute interface.
ExternalFunction takes as input a cmd_bfr, as defined in
ExternalFunctionMsg.h, and depending on the fields set in the cmd_bfr,
it will perform a variety of operations such as displaying a 3 bit
number on the LEDS, start/stop the OSCOPE, turn on/off the SOUNDER,
jam the radio by transmitting a 1 bit, start the LOGGER, adjust the
clock rate of the ATMega processor.
