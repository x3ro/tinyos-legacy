README for MicasbTest2
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu
 
Description:
 
The MicasbTest2 tests out light, microphone, and sounder.  
Covering the light sensor will trigger the sounder to beeps.  If the microphone
detects the sounder's signal, it will turn on the yellow LED to signal the
tone is detected.
 

Tools:
 
None
 
Known bugs/limitations:
 
Since the microphone is very close to the sounder, the signal it gets
may clip at the amplifier and you may not be able to see the 
microphone detecting the sounder's signal.  

To avoid this problem, either decrease the microphone gain or
use another MICA running the TestSounder application and try this
test with the two MICAs separated by a feet or two.
