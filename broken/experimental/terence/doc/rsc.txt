total number of packet send by mote
total number of packet received by that mote
route tree
how many packet actually is lost/dropped
connectivity
show neighbor list
numnber of retransmistion for packets
stability
how many neighbors
dump data same format
time, number of packets receive
sbaility over time how many nodes switch parent
link quality to parent
change color grey red, gone
drage the nodes around
where is the network load
append the forwader source

+ Introduction
  - Goal: to minimize changes when format changes  
  - modular! easy to switch data packet, easy to bind analysis in and out
  - provides some features of people who do not use matlab

+ Statistic Collector Component
  - Written in nesc
  - sniff in MHDispatcher
  - regularly send out different kind of statistic packet
  - send throught the route tree

+ Collector Layer / DB Interface (Java)
  - Listen Comm - Extract bytes to feed Collect Packet
  - Collect Packet
    * create table in sql
    * packets is stored as raw byte? 0x hex?

  - Sql interface
    * provide interface for matlab to use sql to query those view

+ Analyzer Layer (Matlab)
  - Packet Format / Query
    * put all specific sql query for this type of packets here

  - Event queue
    * call analysis to see how often certain analysis should be evaluated
    * schedule evaluation every x for analisis y

  - Analysis
    * call such and such query from packet format
    * specific gui function for displaying the result of the analysis
    * Analsiss
      # route tree visualizing
      # stabilty plot
      # number of packet received over time
      # link quality to parents
      # cumulative hop count
      # hop count over distance
      # distance vs path estimation
      # number of packets sent over time
      # time elapse
      # overall success rate
      # success rate in respect to a mote
    * initalise, type in external data like distance

  - Gui
    * provides button, library to draw lines, move motes
    * initialize event queue, what type of analysis we want
