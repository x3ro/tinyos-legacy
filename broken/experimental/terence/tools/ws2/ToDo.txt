
Simulator itself
- randomly place in a cell
- need to specify density
- effective range is about 12 feet
- Let's take a 12x12 square, how many nodes can you fit into it
  - If you want cell density to be N, there should be (N+1) nodes

mh_send_retransmit 
- just a FIFO send queue that handles retransmission
- for now, the queue is infinite, and all broadcast messages are
  in the same queue.  (No retransmission for broadcast messages
  since they are always return with a true result).


----------
At this moment, all messages are on the queue.
Broadcast messages will have no ACK.
No flow or congestion control.
Transmission queue is infinite.

 
shortest_path and mrp_shortest_path
- needs to break apart to neighbor_hood estimator (easy)(done)
- just clean up (done)
- When a neighbor is removed, removed all the previous data. (done)
- extract link estimator from the parent selection algorithm (done)
- sort according out_est for the top six neighbors. (done)

- compare with old data???


- tune time_out value for mobility?


Well, basically how long does it take to warm up?
- basically, how many steps of updates
  - vary with 
    - number of nodes
    - average cell density
    - link estimator
    - topology
    - number of nodes to give feedback
    - protocol specific:
      - threshold, mrp noise margin
  - metrics
    - stability
    - quality of the tree
 	- path reliablity, historgram
        - hop count, histogram
    - (link estimator affects errors and how fast the warm up phase is)
    - can you guess?
Basically, what's the maintanence phase of updates to
make the network responsive?
- vary
  - exchange rate vs. data rate
  - sudden changes or mobility
  - link estimator
  - optional:  queue length
- metrics
  - (pretty stable) responsiveness to changes
  - retransmission overhead
  - success rate to base station


What's the ratio between warmup and steady state?
- application depenedent
- how much mobility can steady state keep up?
