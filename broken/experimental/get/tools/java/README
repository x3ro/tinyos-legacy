WebMote v0.2

WebMote is a bridge between the mote world and the HTTP-based web
services world. 

Compile the java classes, set up a mote to emit packets over its
serial connection (i.e. a TOSBase and CntToLedsAndRfm) then run:

  java WebMote

This launches a webserver on local port 80.

Load the following URL in your browser:

  http://localhost/webmote/

This will show you a list of motes you can access. To add another
mote, you can edit the "motes.txt" file in the local directory. Each
line of the file has the following format:

"<name of the mote> <MOTECOM required to connect to it>"

If you are a Telos user, run the "moteupdate.pl" script and leave it
running in the background. It will periodically call "motelist" and
dump the results to afile called "motelist.txt", that WebMote will
periodically load. This means that Telos motes will be auto-detected
and added to the list as you plug them in.

Click on a mote to start receiving packets from it. The packets will
keep coming until you close the connection, and will start coming
again when you reload the URL.

The 'curl' tool, run as:

  curl http://localhost/webmote/bridge?mote=<some mote name>

will act like the java Listen tool, dumping raw packets to stdout.
