check for:
  overflow of stkdepth (255 max)
  too many args, local or closure vars (128 max)

remove op_return (it's always the last byte of a function)
  (or at least make it implicit if you run over the end of a fn)

in dump:
  check for excessive size, object length overflow
  mybe check for int overflow ?
