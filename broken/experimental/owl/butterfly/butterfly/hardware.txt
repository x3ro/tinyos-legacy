Hardware resource usage:

Pins
----

The LCD consumes ports A, C, D, and pins PG0-4

The temperature sensor is on ADC0 (PF0)
The (external) voltage sensor is on ADC1 (PF1)
The photo sensor is on ADC2 (PF2)
The ADC voltage reference comes from PF3

The JTAG interface uses PF4-7. Available via a connector when JTAG is not used

The serial (RS232) port uses PE0, PE1

The dataflash uses PB0-3 and PE7. PB1-3 are also available on the board edge
(for ISP)

The joystick uses PB4, PB6, PB7, PE2 and PE3

The sounder uses PB5

The USI interface uses pins PE4-6. Available via a connector (for any purpose).

Timers
------

Timer 2 is used by the Timer/Clock component. It is clocked from the external
32kHz crystal.

Timer 1 is used by the sounder.

The joystick assumes it is the only source of external interrupts. This would
need changing if one wanted external interrupts via PE4-6.

Timers 1 & 2 are used at boot time to calibrate the internal oscillator
(should not cause any problems).
