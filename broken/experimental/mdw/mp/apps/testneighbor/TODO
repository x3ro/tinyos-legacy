- Add stopstring for "all motes" condition to arPlugin
- Check validity of Yao Graph:
   - Get positions of motes (check for bad positions due to missing
     initialization)
   - Build up graph from YaoNeighborhoodM's "fixed" edges set
   - Check for crossed edges
   - Look at invalidations sent vs. invalidations received
