- '.self' and '.length' syntax
- sync() call
- '.neighbors[n]' syntax to access neighbor sets

- Add back notion of tasks - allow event handlers to post tasks that
  run in a fiber context

- Add back component model - not difficult, just have ncs.jj understand
  'call' and 'signal' as well as basic structure ('provides', 'uses',
  etc.)
