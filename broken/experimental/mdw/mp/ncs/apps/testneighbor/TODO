- Seem to be waking up too early from sleep on
  YaoNeighborhood.getNeighborhood()

- NCSLibM wants to wake up a fiber from location queue (and others??)
  even when we haven't posted any location requests - due to getting
  getLocDone event from elsewhere - need to maintain per-fiber state
  (i.e. is fiber sleeping on this queue?)
