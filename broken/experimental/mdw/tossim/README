This is a drop-in replacement for TOSSIM's radio stack that operates at
the packet, rather than the bit, level. In preliminary testing it
performs about 100 times faster than the default bit-level radio stack.
Obviously it does not capture the subtleties and behavior of the
bit-level simulation, but, it is useful for testing and simulating large
networks. 

To use this code, all you need to do is add the line
  PFLAGS = -I/path/to/tinyos/broken/experimental/mdw/tossim
to your application Makefile, then rebuild your application with 'make pc'.

This packet-level simulation is compatible with TOSSIM's lossy radio
models, so if you are using "-r lossy" or setting link-level loss
probabilities with TinyViz, it will work.
