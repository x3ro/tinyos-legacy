This directory contains some sample code for what a network
architecture using the OSKI methodology would look like. Four directories:

interfaces:         Where all of the interfaces are
components:         Where the underlying implementations and configurations
                    are. Users shouldn't look at these.
services:           Where the abstractions a user deals with are. Senders,
                    receivers, etc.
examples:           Some examples of what using this approach would look like
                    to an application programmer.
