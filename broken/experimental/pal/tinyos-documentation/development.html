    <h1>TinyOS Contribution Guidelines</h1>

    <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the two different ways of
    contributing code to the TinyOS code repository.</p>

    <h2>How do I contribute code, bug fixes, etc.?</h2>

    <p>Contributions take two forms: <i><b>core</b></i> and
      <i><b>extensions</i></b>. The core refers to the set of standard
      services and components distributed in a TinyOS release. For example,
      AM-level network stacks, timers, and drivers for several common sensor
      boards are part of the TinyOS core. TinyOS extensions are software
      developed outside of the core. These range from complete
      application/tool-chains, such as TinyDB, to alternative MAC protocols,
      such as S-MAC. The TinyOS developers are responsible for the core while
      extensions have their own developers and maintainers.
      
      Read the descriptions below to decide which category your contribution
      falls into and follow the corresponding instructions.</p>

    <h3>Core Contributions</h3>

    <p>The core contains only essential code that all TinyOS
    applications require.  The core is supported by core developers,
    works on all supported platforms and is backward compatible.
    </p>

    <p> All bug-fixes and feature additions are documented in
    the bug tracker.  Core developers will not change a file unless there is an
    outstanding item in the bug tracker that references that file. 
    This has the dual purpose of creating
    a record of every change to core system components as well as allowing
    developers to review, comment,and edit pending changes before they happen. 
    </p>

    <p> If you would like to submit a bug report or feature request to the core
    you can do so at <a
    href=none>http://cvs.sourceforge.net/projects/tinyos/bugtracker</a>.  Bug
    reports should contain a clear, reproducible bug description and feature
    requests should provide a functional test of the new feature.
    Submitting a patch with a change request will probably expedite its
    incorporation, and you may also <a href=non>contact</a> the core developer
    responsible for incorporating this type of change request.</p>

    <h3>Extensions</h3>
      
    <p>A TinyOS extension is essentially anything that is not
    supported by the core developers.  The term "extensions" covers a
    wide range of projects, from personal efforts to heavily
    engineered and tested functionality.  The TinyOS tree divides them
    into two categories: modules and contributions, each with its own
    level of support. Anyone can -- and is encouraged to -- write a
    TinyOS extension. In general, support is provided by the
    extension's authors instead of the core
    developers. Correspondingly, it is possible for extensions to fall
    into an unsupported state.
 
    <p><b>Module:</b> A module should be compatible with the main
      tree, and can be added with a single change to the compiler's include 
      path. Modules are usually system-level services like multi-hop routing
      algorithms, specialized mac protocols, time-sync, etc.  TinyOS modules
      exist in <tt>tos/lib</tt>; each module has its own sub directory. If
      possible, the code should all be in this top-level directory, but very
      large modules can be broken into subdirectories (e.g., lib/VM/opcodes,
      lib/VM/contexts).
      Module maintainers are responsible for ensuring that their extension
      meets the above requirements. If a module doesn't, the core developers
      may reclassify it as a contribution.</p>
    </p>

    <p><b>Contribution:</b> A TinyOS contribution is not guaranteed to be
      compatible with the main tree nor can it be used with a simple change to
      the include path. TinyOS contributions exist in <tt>contrib</tt>.
      Contributions can include significant changes to core services. For
      example, a routing protocol that prohibits the use of Active Messages
      would be a contribution.  Other examples include Tiny Diffusion, which is
      complete code that people are welcome to use, tinker with, and extend, but
      is not a system-level service like a module.</p>

    <p>If you would like to add a module, send a request
      to <A
      HREF="mailto:cvs-access@mail.millennium.berkeley.edu">cvs-access@mail.millennium.berkeley.edu</A>,
      giving a brief description of the code and that it's a module.
      All TinyOS developers should have open access to <tt>contrib/</tt> 
      by default,
      and are free to check in contributions there.
      The top-level directory of each extension must have a status.txt file
      explaining the name of the extension, what it does, contact info of the
      authors, and its current status (eg. beta, v.2.1, being incorporated into
      core, etc).
