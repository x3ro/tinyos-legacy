Spantree region notes

- Region.getRegion() is invoked by the root, which causes the spanning 
  tree to be formed. (Non-root nodes do participate in spanning tree
  formation, of course, but do not call getRegion() themselves.)

- TupleSpace.put(): If a non-root node, sends to the root (caching along
                        the way!)
                    If the root node, floods to all nodes
 
- TupleSpace.get(): Reads a locally-cached value
   Supports NODE_ANY as an address for the get, which iterates through 
   all cached values matching the given key

- Reduce.reduceToOne(): Only works from the root; causes a reduction
  initation message to be flooded through the network, causing the
  reduction to occur. Nodes may be able to respond to the reduction
  without collecting further data, since they have cached previous put()
  data from their children

              
Implementing TinyDiff:
  - Root does a 'put' of an interest variables (floods to network)
  - All other nodes do a periodic 'get' to see if the interest matches
    their data
  - If so, they do a 'put' of their data which sends it up to the root
  - Root does a periodic 'get_all' to get all variables pushed up
