NOTE : The SimDriver and TinyViz code is still very fresh. Your mileage
may vary. This is an incomplete list of things that I know need to be
done.

- clean up reflect/Commands.java

- fix bug in RadioModelGuiPlugin where it doesn't reflect the scripted
  changes

- pause callbacks to optionally take an event parameter

- pauseSimInFuture is a misnomer since it doesn't really pause the
  simulation, better would be eventInFuture

- resolve variable failure shouldn't generate an exception

- get rid of the AttributeChangedEvent for LEDs

- fix up autorun (deprecate??)

- autorun debug messages -> SimDebug

- get rid of socket based console, make console default, socket
  secondary
