<h1>
Lesson 1: Introduction to TinyOS</h1>
<h3>Components, Composition, and Basic Use of
Commands and Events.</h3>
<p>
<h2> Introduction </h2>

We introduce the basic TOS concepts through a very simple example
that periodically blinks the LEDs.&nbsp; The application can be found at
<tt><a href="../../apps/blink">nest/apps/blink</a></tt>.&nbsp;
We will work on understanding this application from the inside out. 
The heart of this application is provided by a single component, <tt>blink</tt>.

<h2> Components </h2>
<a NAME="tos_component"></a>A <i><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>TOS component</FONT></i>
consists of an <i>implementation</i> and an <i>interface</i>, described
by a <tt>.c</tt> file and a <tt>.comp</tt> file, respectively, here&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../apps/blink/blink.c">nest/apps/blink/blink.c</a></tt>
and&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../apps/blink/blink.comp">nest/apps/blink/blink.comp</a>.</tt>

<p><a NAME="tos_component_implementation"></a>
A <i><font color="#FF0000">TOS component implementation</font></i> 
may contain a frame, a set of event handlers,
a set of commands, a set of tasks, and local procedures.&nbsp; The commands
must match the commands it claims to accept in the interface and similarly
the events must match the events it claims to handle.&nbsp; The external
namespace of the implementation is the commands it uses and events it signals.&nbsp;
The implementation must include <tt>tos.h</tt> and <tt>NAME.h</tt>, where
<tt>NAME</tt>
is the name of the component.

<p><a NAME="tos_component_interface"></a> A
<i><font color="#FF0000">TOS
component interface</font></i> specifies the name of the component module, describes
the set of commands the component accepts, the commands that it uses, the
events that it handles, and the events it signals.&nbsp; The implementation
is written in terms of the interface namespace.&nbsp; The syntax of the
interface file is
<blockquote><tt><font color="#FF0000">TOS_MODULE <i>name</i>;</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">ACCEPTS{</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>command_signatures</i></font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">};</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#FF0000">HANDLES{</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>event_signatures</i></font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">};</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#FF0000">USES{</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>command_signatures</i></font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">};</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#FF0000">SIGNALS{</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>event_signatures</i></font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">};</font></tt></blockquote>


<h3>Frames</h3>
<a NAME="tos_frame"></a>
A <i><font color="#FF0000">TOS frame</font></i> contains
all static variables available to the implementation of the component.
Variables within the frame are referenced using the <tt>VAR</tt> macro.
<p>Looking at the implementation itself,&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../apps/blink/blink.c">nest/apps/blink/blink.c</a></tt>
consists of a frame, two commands and one event handler.&nbsp; The frame
contains a single static variable, <tt>state</tt>.&nbsp; The two commands
support a simple initialization protocol.&nbsp; By convention, we provide
a <tt>MAIN</tt> component which starts up on hardware reset and invokes an <tt>INIT</tt>
command followed by a <tt>START</tt> command.&nbsp; This allows the collection of
components forming an application to come up cleanly.

<h3>Commands</h3>
<a NAME="tos_command"></a>
A <i><font color="#FF0000">TOS command</font></i>
is declared as <tt>char TOS_COMMAND(cmd_name)(cmd_param_list)</tt>. The
return value is the status of the request: 0 = failure.&nbsp; A command
may call commands, or post tasks, but may not signal events.&nbsp; It must
complete in a bounded, but not necessarily short, amount of time.&nbsp;
It cannot block or spin waiting for state changes.

<p>A TOS command is called using <tt><font color=#ff0000>TOS_CALL_COMMAND</font></tt><tt>(cmd_name)(cmd_args_list)</tt></font>

<p>The <tt>BLINK_INIT</tt> command turns off all the LEDs and initializes its frame.
It then initializes subcomponents, passing an argument that indicates it
should receive a clock event at 1 hz.&nbsp; The mapping from simple clock
period to hardware specific values is provided by <tt><a href="../../tos/platform/mica/include/hardware.h">nest/tos/platform/NAME/include/hardware.h</a></tt>.

<p>The <tt>BLINK_START</tt> command does nothing more in this case.After the initialization
phase, this component is merely asleep until events occur.

<h3>Events</h3>

<p><a NAME="tos_event"></a>
A <i><font color="#FF0000">TOS event</font></i> is
declared as <tt>char TOS_EVENT(evnt_name)(evnt_arg_list)</tt>.&nbsp; Lowest level
events are connect directly to hardware interrupts by the system hardware
abstraction layer.&nbsp; It does key work before reenabling interrupts.&nbsp;
An event may signal events, call commands, or post tasks.&nbsp; It must
complete in a short amount of time, bounded by the jitter requirements
of the overall application.

<p>A TOS event is signalled using <tt><font color=#ff0000>TOS_SIGNAL_EVENT</font>(evnt_name)(evnt_arg_list)</tt>

<p>The <tt>BLINK_CLOCK_EVENT</tt> is intended to handle clock events on a periodic
basis.&nbsp; It utilizes an internal state variable to keep track of the
state of the red LED and toggles the LED on each clock tick.
<p>
Looking at the interface definition,&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../apps/blink/blink.comp">nest/apps/blink/blink.comp</a></tt>,
we see that it state the module name <tt>BLINK</tt>, declares the two commands
it accepts and the one event it handles.&nbsp; These declarations match
the signatures of the associated procedures in the implementation.&nbsp;
It also declares that it uses a <tt>SUB_INIT</tt> command and a family of LED commands.&nbsp;
It signals no events.

<h2> TinyOS Applications </h2>
<a NAME="tos_application"></a>
A <i><font color="#FF0000">TOS application</font></i>
consists of a graph of components.&nbsp; A textual representation of this
graph is contained in the description file for the applicaiton, here 
<tt><a href="../../apps/blink/blink.desc">nest/apps/blink/blink.desc</a></tt>.

<p>The TinyOS component approach separates creation
of the components from their composition.&nbsp; It makes it very easy to
swap components in and out and interpose components.&nbsp; It also limits
the interactions between components to very narrow channels.

<p><a NAME="tos_description"></a>
A <i><font color="#FF0000">TOS description
file</font></i> specifies the set of component modules used in the application
and the wiring of commands and events across component interfaces.&nbsp;
The component module name should match the root of the interface and the
implementation file, case sensitive, as well as the module name in the
.comp file.&nbsp; The wiring must be a subset of the interface elements
associated with the components.&nbsp; There is a search path associated
with resolution of module, typically consisting of "., tos/system, tos/platform,
tos/shared".&nbsp; The syntax is as follows.</font>
<blockquote><font color="#FF0000">i<tt>nclude modules{</tt></font>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>module list</i></font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">};</font></tt>
<p><i><tt><font color="#FF0000">connection list</font></tt></i></blockquote>

<h2> The <tt>BLINK</tt> Example</h2>
In our example we have four components: <tt>MAIN, BLINK,CLOCK, LEDS</tt>.&nbsp;
<tt>MAIN</tt> is a platform-dependent startup component used for initialization.&nbsp;
It is located at&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../tos/platform/mica/MAIN.comp">nest/tos/platform/NAME/MAIN.comp</a></tt>.&nbsp;
Looking at that interface reveals that it is richer than what is used here.&nbsp;
<tt>CLOCK</tt> is a platform-dependent component that provides an abstraction of
the clock device and handles the associated hardware interrupts.&nbsp;
It is located at&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../tos/platform/mica/CLOCK.comp">nest/tos/platform/NAME/CLOCK.comp</a></tt>.
In addition to initializing the clock period and signalling clock event,
the clock value can be queried and set.&nbsp; LED is a system component
that provides basic low-level commands to actuate the LEDs.&nbsp; It is
located at&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../tos/system/LEDS.comp">nest/tos/system/LEDS.comp</a></tt>.

<p><i>To build this application, cd into the <tt><a href="../../apps/blink">nest/apps/blink</a></tt>
and type <tt>make</tt>.</i>&nbsp; (On windows, you should do this within
a CygWin command window.&nbsp; The gcc tools may behave strangely in a
DOS command window.)&nbsp; By default, it will make an executible for each
platform.&nbsp; To build for only the mica platform, type <tt>make mica</tt>.&nbsp;
All objects, generated includes, and executibles are place in the bin directory
for the specific platform, eg, <tt>binmica/</tt>.&nbsp; You should, of course, observe
errors and warnings that arise in building your application.&nbsp; This
example should not have any. At the very end, the Make shows you a piece
of the load map that tells you whether your application fits.

<p>To download your program into the Mica wireless sensor node, <i>place
the Mica board (or board and sensor stack) into the bay on the programming
board</i>, as shown below.&nbsp; You can either supply a 3 volt supply
to the connector on the programming board or power the node directly.&nbsp;
The red LED labeled D2 on the programming board will be on when power is
supplied.&nbsp; <i>Plug the 32-pin connector into the parallel port of
a laptop</i> configured with the TOS tools, or connect use a standard mail-female
DB32 parallel port cable.&nbsp; Make sure that the switch on the side of
the programming board is on BIG_GUY.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Type <tt>make install mica</tt>.
<p>If you get:
<blockquote>uisp -dprog=dapa -dno-poll --erase
<br>Probably the AVR MCU is not in the RESET state.
<br>Check it out and run me again.
<br>make: *** [install] Error 2</blockquote>
check first whether the power is on.&nbsp; If you are using an IBM ThinkPad,
it may be necessary to tell the tools to use lpt3.&nbsp; You can do this
by adding a line
<br>HOST = THINKPAD
<br>before the include statement in <i><a href="../../apps/blink/Makefile">nest/apps/blink/Makefile</a></i>
<p>It should look something like the following:
<blockquote><i><tt>$ make install mica</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>avr-objcopy --output-target=srec binr</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>uisp -dprog=dapa -dno-poll -dlpt=3 --</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Atmel AVR AT90S8535 is found.</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Erasing device ...</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Reinitializing device</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Atmel AVR AT90S8535 is found.</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>sleep 1</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>uisp -dprog=dapa -dlpt=3 --upload if=</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Atmel AVR AT90S8535 is found.</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Uploading: flash</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>sleep 1</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>uisp -dprog=dapa -dlpt=3 -dno-poll --</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Atmel AVR AT90S8535 is found.</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>Verifying: flash</tt></i>
<br><i><tt>make: Nothing to be done for `mica'.</tt></i></blockquote>
The red LED should blink on and off and 0.5 Hz.
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Modify <tt>blink.c</tt> to display the low three bits of a counter
on the LEDs.
<p><i>To peek at the answer, you can look in <tt>apps/count</tt>.</i>
<p><i>An even more useful example appears in <tt>apps/cnt_to_leds</tt>.&nbsp;
It abstracts the display capability into a component called <tt>INT_TO_LEDS</tt>.&nbsp;
By just changing the <tt>desc</tt> file, the output device can be switched to the
network.&nbsp; That is done in <tt>apps/cnt_to_rfm.</tt></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Note:</b> <tt>make clean</tt> will clean up all generated files.&nbsp; If your directory
seems cluttered , it is often a good idea to run <tt>make clean</tt>.
