Lesson 2: Event-driven Sensor Acquisition</h1>

<p><br>This lesson illustrates the basic TOS pattern of event-driven processing.&nbsp;
We extend the COUNT example from Lesson 1 to display values obtained from
the photo sensor on the LEDs.&nbsp; This is located in <a href="../../apps/test_sense_broken">nest/apps/test_sense_broken</a>.&nbsp;
The desc file has been augmented to include a PHOTO component.&nbsp; It
can be found at&nbsp; <a href="../../tos/system/PHOTO.comp">nest/tos/system/PHOTO.comp</a>.
Take a look at that component.&nbsp; It provides an INIT command, typical
of all components, a GET_DATA command, and a DATA_READY event.&nbsp; (We'll
ignore the PWR command for now).&nbsp; The idea is that sensor data acquisition
takes time and we want to free up the processor for other work, or shut
it down, while this take place.&nbsp; The GET_DATA command initiates data
acquisition from the sensor; when the data is ready the sensor component
will signal the data ready event.
<p>A typical use of this is shown in&nbsp; <a href="../../apps/test_sense_broken/sense.c">nest/apps/test_sense_broken/SENSE.c</a>.
To obtain a periodic sampling of sensor data, the clock event issues a
command to request data acquisition, as follows:
<p><tt>void TOS_EVENT(SENSE_CLOCK_EVENT)(){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TOS_CALL_COMMAND(SENSE_GET_DATA)();</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>A event handler is provided to catch the data when it is ready.&nbsp;
It renders the data to the LEDs such that they will be off when the node
is in the light and on when it is in the dark.&nbsp; The mica sensor yields
a 10-bit digitized sample of the photo cell.&nbsp; Here we take the upper
three bits.
<p><tt>char TOS_EVENT(SENSE_DATA_READY)(int data){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; display(7 - ((data >> 7) &amp; 0x7));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return 1;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>In this example, we have broken apart the INIT and START protocol, such
that INIT wakes up all subcomponents besides the clock and START wakes
up the clock component.&nbsp; Check the interface provided in <a href="../../apps/test_sense_broken/SENSE.comp">nest/apps/test_sense_broken/SENSE.comp</a>.
to see the new elements of the interface and <a href="../../apps/test_sense_broken/sense.desc">nest/apps/test_sense_broken/sense.desc</a>
to see the new components and wiring.
<p>Since we have provided the complete solution, we have put a bug in it
so that you can get a chance to experience debugging event-driven code
from the LEDS.&nbsp; The basic technique for this is to insert statements
into the code so that you can perceive the flow of events.&nbsp; We have
provided a reasonable set of these in commented lines.
<p>To see that it does not work, type <tt>make install mica</tt>.&nbsp;
This compiles and downloads the final image.&nbsp; Cover the photo sensor
- no LEDs go on.
<p>Uncomment the LED debugging statements and rebuild it.&nbsp; Now can
you see where you get stuck?&nbsp; Can you see the bug?&nbsp; Hint: there
are two aspects to a TinyOS application, the components and their composition.
<p>When you have fixed this and are ready to explore, take another look
at&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../tos/system/PHOTO.comp">nest/tos/system/PHOTO.comp</a>.
Notice that the module is 'jointly implemented' by PHOTO.&nbsp; Descriptions
are hierarchical and a component can be the root of additional components.&nbsp;
This is described by&nbsp; <a href="../../tos/system/PHOTO.desc">nest/tos/system/PHOTO.desc</a>.
The PHOTO component is built on top of the ADC component.&nbsp; In fact,
all sensors on the platform share the same ADC resource.&nbsp; The ADC
component dispatches the data event to the appropriate sensor component.
<p>The remaining command in the PHOTO component powers the sensor ON or
OFF.&nbsp; The photo cell is essentially a variable resistor, so it draws
power.&nbsp; If it is not being used, it should be powered off.

Extra Credit:</h2>
<p>1.)&nbsp; Extend the capability of the application by making sound using the
sensor board's sounder when it is dark!&nbsp; The TOS component of the sounder
is located at <a href="../../tos/system/SOUNDER.comp">/nest./tos/system/SOUNDER.comp</a>.&nbsp;
The sounder component provides simple command to power on or off the device like
the LEDs.<p>2.)&nbsp; Now, you can make sound.&nbsp; The next thing to explore
is to detect the sound through the microphone.&nbsp; You need two nodes for this
exercise: one is to generate sound and the other is to detect it.&nbsp; We have
provided you an application <a href="../../apps/tone_detect">/nest/apps/tone_detect</a>
that will filter out the tone detector's output and blink the yellow LED should
it detects the sounder's signal.&nbsp; To generate sound, you can either use
part 1 or use <a href="../../apps/test_sounder">/nest/apps/test_sounder</a> that
will periodically chirp the sounder.<p>&nbsp;
