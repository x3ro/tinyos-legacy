    <h1>Lesson 6: Broadcasting packets</h1>

    <p>

    This tutorial consists of three parts: first we'll demonstrate how to
    inject control packets into the network, and to control various functions
    on the mote. As an exercise, we'll add a code to control the buzzer. Then
    we'll look at how to implement a simple multihop broadcast protocol.

      <h2> Part a: Injecting packets </h2> 

    In most of the mote applications the bridge between the mote network and
    your PC is provided by two applications: <tt>GENERIC_BASE_HIGH_SPEED</tt>
    on the mote side and <tt>SerialForwarder</tt> on the PC side.  Program one
    mote with <tt>GENERIC_BASE_HIGH_SPEED</tt>, and another with
    <tt>COMMAND</tt> which can be found in <tt>nest/apps/bcast</tt>.  You'll
    note that the <tt>COMMAND</tt> mote seems to be idle; that's the expected
    behavior, since it is purely reactive. Plug the <tt>
    GENERIC_BASE_HIGH_SPEED</tt> mote into the programming board, and make
    sure that the programming board is also connected to the serial port. Turn
    on the mote.  On your laptop start the SerialForwarder (if you haven't
    already) by executing:</p>
   
<pre>
cd tools
java net/tinyos/SerialForwarder/SerialForward
</pre>

    Now you're ready to start injecting packets.  We provided a simple packet
    injector called <a href="../../tools/net/tinyos/tools/BcastInject.java">
    net.tinyos.tools.BcastInject</a>. To inject a specific into the network
    run

<pre>
javac net/tinyos/tools/BcastInject.java
java net.tinyos.tools.BcastInject
</pre>

    <tt> BcastInject</tt> constructs TinyOS packets, and injects them into the
    network using the SerialForwarder.  The <tt>BcastInject</tt> currently
    understands  how to generate packets that will cause the <tt>COMMAND</tt>
    mote to turn LEDs on and off, and to adjust the transmit strength.</p>

    <h3> Part a: Exercise</h3>
    
    Add commands that will enable the <tt>COMMAND</tt> mote to turn its
    sounder on and off. You'll need to perform the following modifications:

    <ul> 
      <li> In <tt>COMMAND.comp</tt> declare that the component uses the
	sounder methods 

      <li> In <tt>COMMAND.c</tt> initialize the sounder and add statements
	that will turn the sounder on and off. 

      <li> Finally in the description file, connect the <tt>SOUNDER</tt>
	component to the <tt>COMMAND</tt> component. 
    </ul> 

    <h2> Part b: Multihop broadcast</h2>

    In this part of the exercise, we'll take the <tt>COMMAND</tt> component
    from the previous part, and we'll insert a flooding layer to forward the
    messages.  The <tt>BCAST</tt> component shows a simple implementation of
    flooding the network from a single location. It doesn't depend on any
    routing schemes, at the core of the module, we embedded the following
    decision: if a node hears a packet that has not been heard before, it will
    rebroadcast it.  The following message handler shows this functionality:
    </p>
<PRE>
// Handler for the flooding the message.
TOS_MsgPtr TOS_MSG_EVENT(BCAST_UPDATE)(TOS_MsgPtr msg) {
    bcastmsg_t * bmsg = (bcastmsg_t *) msg->data;
    TOS_MsgPtr tmp = msg;
    
    // Check if this is a new broadcast message
    if (is_new_msg(bmsg)) {
	remember_msg(bmsg);
	
	// Execute the split-phase command handler for the message.  If the
	// command handler failed, just drop the message, and forget that the
	// message was pending
	if (TOS_CALL_COMMAND(BCAST_CMD_EXEC)(msg) == 0) {
		VAR(bcast_pending) = 0;
	}

	// Return a message buffer to the lower levels, and hold on to the
	// current buffer
	tmp = VAR(msg); VAR(msg) = msg;
    }
    return tmp;
}
</PRE>

    The main challenge lies in determining what constitutes a new message. The
    <tt>BCAST</tt> component expects that each message carries a sequence
    number:

<PRE>
typedef struct {
    char seqno;            // Sequence number which determines whether the
                           // message needs to be rebroadcast.
}bcastmsg_t;
</PRE>

    Given the sequence number, we can determine whether the message is new by
    remembering the sequence number of the last message we heard and comparing
    it to the sequence number of the current message:

<PRE>
// Decision whether the message is new: it has to be within 127 sequence
// numbers of the last number. We'll also throw out the message if we're still
// dealing with the previous broadcast. 

inline char is_new_msg(bcastmsg_t *bmsg) {
    return ((((bmsg->seqno) - VAR(lastSeqno)) > 0) && 
	    (VAR(bcast_pending) == 0));
}
</PRE>
    <p>
    <tt>BCAST</tt> expects to process only a single message at a time, so if
    the component is busy, even a message that is potentially new, will be
    discarded.  Also note that the component does a fair bit of
    overbroadcasting, so it is possible that the component will get another
    chance to rebroadcat the packet.</p>


    <p>The command interpreter presented here is used primarily for
    demonstration of the broadcast component. You'll see a more complex
    interpreter in the next tutorial, however the basic design of the module
    stays the same.  You may find this structure useful in other applications.
    In this toy interpreter, the command packets are of the following form:
    </p>

<PRE>
typedef struct {
    char seqno;             //sequence no. for compatibility with BCAST layer
    char action;            //operation mnemonic for the COMMAND component, 
    short source;           //who was the immediate sender of this packet 
    unsigned char hop_count; // how far away from the origin are we?
    char arg[0];            //arguments that the interpreter will act upon
} cmdmsg_t;    
</PRE>

    <p> Note that this violates strict layer separation, since the
    <tt>COMMAND</tt> module sees the fields not relevant to its function
    (e.g. <tt>seqno</tt>). </p>
    
    <p>
      The component exposes two commands: an initialization command,
      <tt>COMMAND_INIT()</tt> and a split-phase interpreter command
      <tt>COMMAND_EXECUTE(TOS_MsgPtr msg)</tt>. The command execution works as
      follows:
    <ul>
      <li> An upper level component calls the <tt>COMMAND_EXECUTE</tt> with a
	<tt>TOS_MsgPtr</tt>. The component is designed to process only a
	single message at a time; if no message is being processed, 
	<tt>COMMAND_EXECUTE </tt> will accept the message for processing, and
	schedule a task <tt>eval_cmd</tt> to do the actual processing.
      <li> At some point in the future, the <tt>eval_cmd</tt> task will
	run. In the current interpreter, the task performs 3 separate
	functions: it updates the fields in the handler, it performs functions
	dependent on the level in the tree, and it executes the command. 
      <li> When the task successfully reaches its end, it signals the upper
	component the completion by invoking <tt>COMMAND_DONE(TOS_MsgPtr msg,
	  char status)</tt>. The status word indicates whether the
	<tt>msg</tt> was "consumed", i.e. whether the calling layer should be
	procssing it further. This allows for a more flexible composition of
	packet processing modules. 
    </ul> 

    The interpreter will keep a pointer to the messsage and will release it
    only when the command contained within the packet has finished
    executing. The layers that interact with it should be aware of this
    property. </p>

    <h3> Part b: Simple exercise</h3> 

    Repeat the exercise from Part a. The red and green LEDs are used to
    display the number of hops a message has traveled from the base; position
    the network such that you observe at least 2 hops.

    <h3>Part b: Advanced Exercise</h3>
    As written, the broadcast protocol is fairly fragile: it depends on a
    property that the sequence number on the BcastInject and the the sequence
    number on the mote differ by less that 127.  A better way to distinguish
    between the messages would be to create an index of a few, say 5, most
    recently seen messages.  If the message currently received is not in that
    index, then the node would forward it.  <tt>BcastInjector</tt> can then
    run unmodified, or it could send out messages with random message
    numbers.
