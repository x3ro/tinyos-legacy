    <h1>Lesson 8: Ranging</h1>

    <p>
    This tutorial will discuss ranging, which is the finding of distances 
    between motes.&nbsp; Ranging in TinyOS is done with a component called 
    TOF_RANGING, where TOF stands for Time Of Flight.&nbsp; The TOF_RANGING 
    component has very poor accuracy because it uses minimal computation.&nbsp; 
    However, this makes it very lightweight computationally, so it should not 
    interfere with your application.&nbsp; You can link it into any application 
    by simply initializing it in your description file with the following line:</p>

    <p>
    MYAPP:MYAPP_SUB_INIT TOF_RANGING:TOF_RANGING_INIT </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This component <i>piggybacks </i>on the radio communication stack by 
    sending an acoustic pulse at the same time as the radio packet.&nbsp; The 
    acoustic pulse is time stamped upon arrival and this time stamp is compared 
    to that of the corresponding radio packet.&nbsp; Since sound moves slower 
    than light, the <i>time difference on arrival</i> (TDOA) can be directly 
    translated into the distance between sender and receiver.&nbsp; As we will 
    see, a lot of noise in the time is introduced by variations in the sounder 
    and microphones and this may need to be calibrated out.</p>

    <h2>The Interface</h2>

    <p>The TOF_RANGING component is a <i>passive </i>component.&nbsp; A mote 
    only chirps when commanded to do so.&nbsp; This means that the problem of 
    scheduling chirps, which varies greatly in complexity depending on the 
    application, has been left to the user. One method of scheduling chirps 
    might be to turn ranging on all the time, which is useful in contexts of 
    constant motion.&nbsp; Another method might be to control the chirping from 
    a PC, i.e. centralized scheduling.&nbsp; Another might be to chirp whenever 
    hearing a transmission from an unknown mote, a possible indication of 
    motion.&nbsp; In this section, we only describe the <i>interface </i>that 
    any such scheduler would use.&nbsp; Essentially, the interface allows you to 
    do two things: 1) send a chirp and 2) obtain the resulting ranging estimate.</p>

    <h3>Sending a Chirp</h3>

    <p>There are two ways to command a mote to chirp:<br>
    1.&nbsp; A local function call<br>
    2.&nbsp; A command packet</p>

    <p>The latter of these two methods can be initiated from either a mote or a 
    PC.&nbsp; The following local function calls initiate:</p>

    <p>a chirp in the <i>local </i>mote:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New">
    char TOF_RANGING_CHIRP(char finalAction);<br>
    </font>a chirp in <i>another </i>mote:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New">
    char TOF_RANGING_CHIRP_COMMAND(int moteID, char finalAction, char numChirps);</font></p>

    <p>The latter function initiates the following packet, which can also be 
    initiated from a PC.&nbsp; It initiates a chirp in the mote that receives 
    it:</p>

    <p>FF FF 7D 1D 01 <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">01</span>
    <span style="background-color: #00FFFF">FF</span> 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 </p>

    <p>Where the yellow byte is the <i>finalAction </i>and the blue byte is <i>
    numChirps.</i>&nbsp; The numChirps field indicates how many times the mote 
    should chirp.&nbsp; A setting of 0xFF indicates that the mote should chirp 
    forever.&nbsp; You can stop it with a setting of 0x00.&nbsp; The <i>
    finalAction </i>byte indicates what the mote should do with the final 
    ranging estimate, once obtained, as discussed below.&nbsp; The premise 
    behind this part of the protocol is that the agent that <i>initiates </i>the 
    chirping knows who is interested in the ranging information.</p>

    <p>To initiate the chirp command from a PC, call the tofChirpCommand 
    function in nest/tools/matlab/shared/tofRanging</p>

    <h3>Obtaining a Distance Estimate</h3>

    <p>Once a mote has chirped 4 times, all receivers should have a distance 
    estimate for it.&nbsp; There are two ways to obtain this distance estimate:<br>
    1.&nbsp; the receiver signals a local TOS event<br>
    2.&nbsp; the receiver broadcasts the data&nbsp; <br>
    3.&nbsp; the receiver responds to a request packet&nbsp; </p>

    <p>Whenever 4 chirps <i>with finalAction=0x00 </i>are heard from the same 
    sender, the receiving mote broadcasts the final ranging estimate.&nbsp; 
    Whenever 4 such chirps are heard <i>with finalAction=0x01</i>, however, the 
    following event is signaled:</p>

    <p>char TOF_RANGING_RANGING_DATA_READY(short distance); </p>

    <p>When such a distance estimate is broadcast, it is sent in a <i>response 
    packet</i>, which has the following format:</p>

    <p>FF FF 7D 1D 02 <span style="background-color: #00FF00">11</span>
    <span style="background-color: #FF0000">21 00</span> 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 </p>

    <p>Where the green byte is the receiver's mote ID and the red bytes are the 
    distance estimate in centimeters (cm).&nbsp; This response packet is also 
    sent in response to a request packet, which has the following format:</p>

    <p>FF FF 7D 1D 01 <span style="background-color: #00FF00">10</span> 00 00 00 
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    00 00 00 00 </p>

    <p>Where the green byte is the mote ID of the requester.&nbsp; This request 
    packet can be initiated either by a PC or from within a mote by calling the 
    following function:</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New">char TOF_RANGING_DATA_REQUEST(void);</font></p>

    <p>To initiate the data request from a PC, call the tofRangingDataRequest 
    function in nest/tools/matlab/shared/tofRanging</p>

    <h2>Calibration</h2>

    <p>Unfortunately, the sounder, microphone and tone detector on the mica 
    sensorboard are not very high quality and our distance estimates will be 
    very poor.&nbsp; We can reduce our error, however, by over 100% with 
    calibration.&nbsp; There are two types of calibration that needs to be done:&nbsp; 
    hardware and software.</p>

    <h3>Hardware Modification</h3>

    <p>Resistor R30 on the bottom of the mica sensor board should be about 
    27.4KOhm.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will get no accuracy in your distance 
    estimates at all.&nbsp; This resistor changes the center frequency of the 
    tone detector on the sensor board.&nbsp; Your tone detector should be able 
    to cleanly detect frequencies at least as low as 4.2KHz and hopefully as low 
    as 4.0KHz.&nbsp; The higher the value of the resistor, the lower the center 
    frequency of the tone detector.&nbsp; </p>

    <h3>Software Calibration&nbsp; </h3>

    <p>A tool exists to calibrate the mica sensor board for TOF ranging using 
    the matTOS toolset, which integrates matlab into the TinyOS environment.&nbsp; 
    For an introduction to matTOS, read the
    <a href="../../tools/matlab/docs/index.html">matTOS documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>First, be sure that all motes in your system are mapped to a location, as 
    discussed in the matTOS documentation.&nbsp; Then, add nest/tools/matlab/contrib/kamin/tofCalibation 
    to your path.&nbsp; Then, run the following commands:</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New">initializeTOFcalibration(transmitters, 
    receivers)<br>
    startTOFcalibration</font></p>

    <p>Where <i>transmitters</i> is an array of all IDs of your transmitters and
    <i>receivers</i> is an array of all IDs of your receivers.&nbsp; You will 
    get a prompt that asks you which mote you want to calibrate and what it's 
    current location is:</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New">Enter the ID of the calibrating transmitter 
    (e.g. '213'):<br>
    Enter the coordinates of the calibrating transmitter (e.g. [x y]):</font></p>

    <p>When you enter this information it will command that mote to chirp and 
    listen to the ranging estimates given by all motes you listed as receivers.&nbsp; 
    If the mote fails to chirp, the system will halt.&nbsp; You can use the 
    command</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New">oopsRestartTOFcalibration</font></p>

    <p>to restart the process.</p>

    <p>Since matTOS has a mapping of each receiver to a location and it knows 
    the location of the chirper, it can calculate the true value of each ranging 
    estimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It uses this true value along with the estimate for 
    calibration.&nbsp; It is recommended that you calibrate each mote at several 
    locations within your system.</p>

    <p>When you are done, simply hit ENTER when prompted for a transmitter and 
    the process will terminate.&nbsp; All calibration coefficients for all 
    calibrated motes will be calculated.&nbsp; From this point on, whenever you 
    want to calibrate a reading, use the following function call:</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New">calibrateReading(transmitterID, receiverID, 
    rangingEstimate)</font></p>

    <p>it will take your ranging estimate between your transmitter and receiver 
    and give you a calibrated ranging estimate using the calibration 
    coefficients of that transmitter and that receiver.</p>

    <p>If you are not using matlab in your system, at this point you could 
    retrieve that calibration coefficients using the function</p>
<p>stopTOFcalibration</p>
<p>and port them to your system.&nbsp; Notice also that the nest/tools/matlab/contrib/kamin/localization 
tool automatically uses these calibration coefficients.</p>
