<h1>
Lesson 4: Composing Components to Send and Receive Messages</h1>
This lesson introduces two concepts: hierarchical descriptions of component
graphs and how to form distributed applications that send and receive messages.&nbsp;
The applications that we will consider are <a href="../../apps/cnt_to_leds_and_rfm/cnt_to_leds_and_rfm.desc">apps/cnt_to_leds_and_rfm.desc
</a>and
<a href="../../apps/rfm_to_leds/RFM_TO_LEDS.c">apps/rfm_to_led/rfm_to_leds.desc</a>.&nbsp;
cnt_to_leds_and_rfm is essentially the counting variant of blink except
that it is structured to use a generic output device.&nbsp; Using the desc
file, we can fan out the output to two devices - the LEDS and the Radio.&nbsp;
Down inside of the radio device, we see our messages are sent.&nbsp; rfm_to_leds
illustrates how messages are received; it takes a value that comes in from
a packet and displays it on the LEDS, so the two function like a distributed
display.&nbsp; You could change the count application to something like
sense and you would have a wireless sensor!
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
CNT_TO_LEDS_AND_RFM</h2>
The cnt_to_leds_and_rfm application is essentially an extension of BLINK,
although it is structured to provide a more flexible composition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The entire cnt_to_leds_and_rfm application description includes five components:
<p><tt>include modules{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; MAIN;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; COUNTER;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; INT_TO_LEDS;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; INT_TO_RFM;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; CLOCK;</tt>
<br><tt>};</tt>
<p><tt>As you've seen before, MAIN</tt> is a generic prelude system component
used in most applications.
<tt>CLOCK</tt> is a system component that accepts
an INIT command to set its event frequency and signals a periodic clock
event once initialized.
&nbsp; You may notice that none of these components
are in the application directory, they are all shared among several application.&nbsp;
The logic is convey by the way they are wired together.&nbsp; You may also
notice the LEDS does not even appear.&nbsp; This illustrates how description
files may be used to introduce multicomponent abstractions - they are hierarchical.
<h3>
COUNTER</h3>
The <tt><a href="../../tos/shared/COUNTER.c">tos/shared/COUNTER.c</a></tt>
component is the "guts" of the application.
<p>COUNTER uses a TOS_FRAME to hold a counter state variable.
<br><tt>#define TOS_FRAME_TYPE COUNTER_frame</tt>
<br><tt>TOS_FRAME_BEGIN(COUNTER_frame) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#009900">char state</font>;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>TOS_FRAME_END(COUNTER_frame);</tt>
<p>It accepts INIT and START commands from main to initialize its operation.
<p><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(<font color="#009900">COUNTER_INIT</font>)(){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; VAR(state) = 0; /* initialize output component */</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return TOS_CALL_COMMAND(COUNTER_SUB_OUTPUT_INIT)();</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(<font color="#009900">COUNTER_START</font>)(){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; /* initialize clock component and start event processing
*/</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return TOS_CALL_COMMAND(COUNTER_SUB_CLOCK_INIT)(tick4ps);</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<h3>
COUNTER's Output</h3>
Rather than render the output directly to the LEDS, as in BLINK, COUNTER
calls a command in a generic output device.
<p><tt>void TOS_EVENT(COUNTER_CLOCK_EVENT)(){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; VAR(state) ++;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; TOS_CALL_COMMAND<font color="#009900">(COUNTER_OUTPUT)(VAR(state))</font>;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>The first novel aspect of COUNTER is that COUNTER_OUTPUT is wired into
two output components: <a href="../../tos/shared/INT_TO_LEDS.c">tos/shared/INT_TO_LEDS.c
</a>and
<a href="../../tos/shared/INT_TO_RFM.c">tos/shared/INT_TO_RFM.c</a>.
<p>INT_TO_LEDS is a simple output device, which places the lower three
bits of the integer value onto the LEDS.&nbsp; This gives us the behavior
of the countig variant of BLINK.
<p><tt>COUNTER:COUNTER_OUTPUT INT_TO_LEDS:INT_TO_LEDS_OUTPUT INT_TO_RFM:INT_TO_RFM_OUTPUT</tt>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">A description file may fanout commands or events
to multiple components.&nbsp; The program generation tools handle the actual
fanout.</font></i>
<p>If&nbsp; you examine&nbsp; <a href="../../tos/shared/INT_TO_LEDS.comp">tos/shared/INT_TO_LEDS.comp</a>&nbsp;
you will see a new construct:
<p>TOS_MODULE INT_TO_LEDS;
<br>JOINTLY IMPLEMENTED_BY INT_TO_LEDS;
<p><font color="#FF0000">A component may be the root of a subgraph, described
by the associated description file.&nbsp; This is declared in the comp
file using</font>
<br><tt><font color="#FF0000">JOINTLY IMPLEMENTED BY <i>name</i></font></tt><font color="#FF0000">;&nbsp;
The named file provides the subgraph rooted at the component.</font>
<p>Here&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../tos/shared/INT_TO_LEDS.desc">tos/shared/INT_TO_LEDS.desc</a>&nbsp;
brings in one subcomponent, LED, and provides all the wiring to the primitive
LED functions.
<p>COUNTER also handles the event generated by asynchronous output devices
upon completion.
<p>COUNTER:COUNTER_OUTPUT_COMPLETE INT_TO_RFM:INT_TO_RFM_COMPLETE
<p><tt>/* Output Completion Event Handler</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Indicate that notification was successful */</tt>
<br><tt>char TOS_EVENT(<font color="#009900">COUNTER_OUTPUT_COMPLETE</font>)(char
success)</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; return 1;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
INT_TO_RFM: sending a message</h3>

<p><br>INT_TO_RFM&nbsp; ( <a href="../../tos/shared/INT_TO_RFM.c">tos/shared/INT_TO_RFM.c
) </a>is the real point of this lesson - now nicely abstracted from the
higher level application.&nbsp; It's job is to send a packet&nbsp; containing
the output value to message handlers on all neighboring nodes.
<p>Messages in TinyOS&nbsp; follow the Active Message (AM) model, so when
a packet is injected into the network it names a handler that will be invoked
on the recipient nodes.&nbsp; This fits especially nicely in the TinyOS
event-driven environment, because message arrival is just another kind
of event.
<p>In any messaging layer, there are 5 aspects involved in successful transmission
and reception (1) specifying what message is to be sent, (2) specifying
who is to receive it, (3) determining when the storage associated with
the source message can be reused, (4) providing buffering for the incoming
message, and (5) processing the message.&nbsp; Tiny Active Messages are
no exception, however, the storage management is more constrained than
is typical and the events are more natural.
<p><font color="#FF0000">TOS message buffers are contained in frames and
must be declared using the declaration type TOS_Msg.&nbsp; This provides
a clean way to perform encapsulation as the packet moves through the stack
without copying.</font>
<p>INT_TO_RFM declares a TOS_Msg type variable called, data, inside the
application frame.
<p><tt>#define TOS_FRAME_TYPE INT_TO_RFM_frame</tt>
<br><tt>TOS_FRAME_BEGIN(INT_TO_RFM_frame)</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt><font color="#009900">&nbsp; char pending;</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#009900">&nbsp; TOS_Msg data;</font></tt>
<br><tt>} TOS_FRAME_END(INT_TO_RFM_frame);</tt>
<p>The TOS_Msg structure, defined in <a href="../../tos/include/MSG.h">tos/include/MSG.h
</a>,
has a field "data", which is a character pointer pointing to the beginning
of the message's payload.&nbsp; The payload is currently standardized to
be 30 bytes long, although this is a configuration parameter.
<p>You can bang away at the character string and produce unreadable message
processing code, but a much better way is to let the compiler deal with
all the packaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use a C structure such as <tt>int_to_led_msg
</tt>to describe the format of the packet payload.
<p><tt>typdef struct{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;char val;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;int src;</tt>
<br><tt>}<font color="#009900">int_to_led_msg</font>;</tt>
<p>INT_TO_RFM constructs and sends a message when an upper component such
as COUNTER, issues a command.
<p><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(<font color="#009900">INT_TO_RFM_OUTPUT</font>)(int
val)</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return 0;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>To place the data into the payload, we first declare a <tt><font color="#009900">int_to_led_msg
</font></tt>pointer variable, assign it to the address of the start of
the payload, and fill in the value of each field.
<p><tt>int_to_led_msg* message = (int_to_led_msg*)VAR(data).data;</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>message->val = val;</tt>
<br><tt>message->src = TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS;</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<p>To send out the packet, we call a SEND_MSG command specifying the destination
node address, the handler id on the destination and the source message
buffer (the buffer, not the payload).
<p><tt>if (<font color="#009900">TOS_COMMAND(INT_TO_RFM_SUB_SEND_MSG)(TOS_BCAST_ADDR,
AM_MSG(INT_READING), &amp;VAR(data))</font>)</tt><tt></tt>
<p>This command is a split-phase request, like acquiring sensor data; it
starts the process of sending a message and runs concurrently with the
caller.&nbsp; Notice that the command may fail (like any other); this means
that the messaging component didn't even accept the request.&nbsp; If it
succeeds, it is working on the send.
<p>TOS_BCAST_ADDR is a special address signifying that any node that hears
the message will handle it.&nbsp; This is the native mode of radio operation.&nbsp;
Alternatively, you can specify a particular node and all other that hear
the message will discard it.
<p><tt><font color="#FF0000">The handler that will process the message
on the specfied recipient nodes is specified using AM_MSG(<i>handler_name</i>).</font><font color="#000000">
</font><font color="#FF0000">The handler will be declared as TOS_MSG_EVENT(handler_name).</font></tt>
<p><font color="#000000">In this case</font><tt><font color="#009900">
AM_MSG(INT_READING) </font></tt><font color="#000000">specifies the handler.&nbsp;
Most of the time yu will find that messages are sent to similar conponents
on other nodes, so it make sense to specify the handler on the sending
side.&nbsp; This example is a little unusual as we will build a recipient
application that is different.&nbsp; It will be register in a compatible
fashion.</font><tt><font color="#000000"></font></tt>
<p><font color="#FF0000">TinyOS message buffers follow a strict alternating
ownership protocol to avoid expensive memory management while allowing
concurrent operation.&nbsp; If the message layer accepts the send command,
it owns the send buffer and the requesting component should not touch it
until the send is complete, as indicated by a send_done event.&nbsp; The
requesting component may use any method to track the status of the buffer.</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">The only time pointers are carried across component
boundaries is pointers to TOS_MSGs.</font>
<p>Here we use a pending flag to keep track of the status of the buffer.&nbsp;
If the previous message is still being sent, we cannot touch the buffer,
so we drop this output operation.&nbsp; If the send buffer is available,
we can modify it and request it to be sent.&nbsp; If the send request fails,
we clear the flag, so we can try another one later.&nbsp; (Notice there
is no race condition in the use of the flag.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(INT_TO_RFM_OUTPUT)(int val){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if (<font color="#009900">!VAR(pending</font>)) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VAR(pending) = 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; message->val = val;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; message->src = TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (<font color="#009900">TOS_COMMAND(INT_TO_RFM_SUB_SEND_MSG)(TOS_BCAST_ADDR,</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#009900">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AM_MSG(INT_READING), &amp;VAR(data))</font>) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VAR(pending) = 0; /* request failed,
free buffer */</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return 0;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
GENERIC_COMM network stack</h3>

<p><br>In <a href="../../tos/shared/INT_TO_RFM.desc">tos/shared/INT_TO_RFM.desc</a>,
INT_TO_RFM is wired to <a href="../../tos/shared/GENERIC_COMM.comp">tos/shared/GENERIC_COMM.comp</a>,
which is the component providing the generic network stack.&nbsp; This
is a much more substantial use of hierarchical description files.&nbsp;
If we look inside the joint description,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../tos/shared/GENERIC_COMM.desc">tos/shared/GENERIC_COMM.desc</a>,
we see that it contains six additional components, from the high level
messaging component all the way down to modulation of individual bits on
the radio link.&nbsp; Many of these components exist in numerous versions
for different application contexts, but this is nicely abstracted.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The <font color="#009900">TOS_CALL_COMMAND(INT_TO_RFM_SUB_SEND_MSG)(TOS_BCAST_ADDR,</font>
<br><font color="#009900">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AM_MSG(INT_READING), &amp;VAR(data))</font>
<p>directly links to
<p><tt>char COMM_SEND_MSG(short addr, char type, TOS_Msg* data)</tt> in
GENERIC_COMM.
<p>The COMM_SEND_MSG command returns a value to indicate whether it accepts
the request or not. Return value of 1 indicates request is accepted while
a return value of 0 indicates rejection.
<p>The destination handler is wired to a specific Active Message handler.&nbsp;
The AM component will dispatch incoming message to many different components
that send messages within an application.
<p>Here the INT_TO_RFM:INT_READING message handler is wired to 
GENERIC_COMM:GENERIC_COMM_MSG_HANDLER_4.&nbsp;
GENERIC_COMM provides the mapping from handler name to handler identifier (here
4).&nbsp; An application specific register of handler types is maintained
in the release.
<p><font color="#FF0000">When transmission of a message is completed, GENERIC_COMM
will signal a COMM_SEND_DONE event to all components that are registered
with the Active Message component.&nbsp; A pointer to the buffer sent is
provided as an argument to the event.</font>
<p>Here this is wired to INT_TO_RFM_SUB_MSG_SEND_DONE event handler.&nbsp;
It checks if the buffer is its own and, if so, clears the pending flag
and signals COUNTER:COUNTER_OUTPUT_COMPLETE.
<p><tt>char TOS_EVENT(INT_TO_RFM_SUB_MSG_SEND_DONE)(TOS_MsgPtr sentBuffer){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if (VAR(pending) &amp;&amp; sentBuffer == &amp;VAR(data))
{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VAR(pending) = 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TOS_SIGNAL_EVENT(INT_TO_RFM_COMPLETE)(1);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return 0;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>This event is broadcast to all potential senders because other components
may have failed to send a previous message and be waiting for the message
layer to become available.&nbsp; We don't want them to spin consuming precious
resources, so the notification is provided.
<p>On the receiving side, the INT_READING msg event will be signaled.&nbsp;
In this case, we will use a different application to handle that.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Receiving Messages with RFM_TO_LEDS</h2>
<a href="../../apps/rfm_to_leds/rfm_to_leds.desc">apps/rfm_to_leds/rfm_to_leds.desc</a>
is the application that receives the message from&nbsp; CNT_TO_LEDS_AND_RFM,
and displays the least significant 3 bits of the integer from the packet
on the LEDs.&nbsp; Similar to CNT_TO_LEDS_AND_RFM,&nbsp; this application
is also a composition of different components.
<p><tt>include modules{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; MAIN;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; RFM_TO_LEDS;</tt>
<br><tt>};</tt>
<p>The RFM_TO_LEDS compoent in tos/shared/RFM_TO_LEDS.desc uses GENERIC_COMM
to receive messages,and INT_TO_LEDS as its output device.
<p><tt>include modules{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; GENERIC_COMM;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; INT_TO_LEDS;</tt>
<br><tt>};</tt>
<p>In <a href="../../tos/shared/RFM_TO_LEDS.desc">tos/shared/RFM_TO_LEDS.desc</a>,&nbsp;
wiring to the GENERIC_COMM for receiving messages, and INT_TO_LEDS for
outputing the value on the LEDs are shown below
<p>RFM_TO_LEDS:<font color="#009900">INT_READING</font> <font color="#3366FF">GENERIC_COMM:GENERIC_COMM_MSG_HANDLER_4</font>
<br>RFM_TO_LEDS:RFM_TO_LEDS_LED_OUTPUT INT_TO_LEDS:<font color="#009900">INT_TO_LEDS_OUTPUT</font>
<p>Recall that <font color="#009900">INT_TO_RFM:INT_READING </font>has
an Active Message handler type that equals <b>4</b>. RFM_TO_LEDS should also
wire its INT_READING handler to have the same Active Message type equals
<b>4</b>.
<p><font color="#FF0000">Storage management of the receiving side is inherently
dynamic.&nbsp; A message arrives and fills a buffer.&nbsp; The Active Message
layer decodes the handler type and dispatches it.&nbsp; It gives the buffer
to the application component when it does so, but the application must
return a pointer to a free buffer upon completion.</font>
<p>All GENERIC_COMM handlers have the following interface that application handler
for incoming messages:.
<p><font color="#3366FF">TOS_MsgPtr GENERIC_COMM_HANDLER_X(TOS_MsgPtr data);</font>
<p>where data is the TOS_Msg pointer pointing to the incoming message.
<p>In RFM_TO_LEDS, this is the <font color="#33CC00">INT_READING</font>
message handler:
<br><tt>/* Active Message handler</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Pull out the data and send it to the output. */</tt>
<p><tt>TOS_MsgPtr TOS_MSG_EVENT(INT_READING)(TOS_MsgPtr msg){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; int_to_led_msg* message = (int_to_led_msg*)msg->data;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; TOS_CALL_COMMAND(RFM_TO_LEDS_LED_OUTPUT)(<font color="#33CC00">message->val</font>);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return msg;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>Observe that the event process the data within the packet and returns
the buffer it was provided.
<p>A clean way to extract the data from the payload is to use the same
<tt><font color="#33CC00">int_to_led_msg</font></tt>
structure that we used in INT_TO_RFM.&nbsp;&nbsp; The integer value can&nbsp;
then be retrieved by the expression, <tt>message->val</tt>.&nbsp; The value
is then passed&nbsp; as an argument to the command RFM_TO_LEDS_LED_OUTPUT,
which displays the least significant 3 bits of the integer on the LEDs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Underlying details</h2>
Each message contains a header containing system specific information.&nbsp;
In order to allow multiple, logically distinct networks to share the channel,
collections of communicating nodes carry a group id.
<p><b><font size=+1>In this lab setting, you will want a unique group id.&nbsp;
Edit apps/Makeinclude and change the line DEFAULT_LOCAL_GROUP = 0x7D to
be the number on your programming board.</font></b>
<p>In addition, the header carries the destination node number (which may
be BCAST_ADDR or the special UART address) and the handler id.
<p>We have standardized our message size to be 36 bytes, where 4 bytes
are allocated for the header (2 bytes for destination, 1 byte for type,
and 1 byte for GROUP_ID), 30 bytes are allocated for application data payload,
and 2 bytes are allocated for 16-bit CRC checksum.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important
to note that there are two addresses that have special purposes. TOS_BCAST_ADDR
(0xffff) is used as a broadcast address while TOS_UART_ADDR (0x7e) is for
messages destined to the serial port directly. Finally, TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS
is the address of the current node.
<h4>
Exercise:</h4>
Question, what would happen if you built multiple cnt_to_leds_and rfm nodes
and turned them on?
<p>Compile and run both <tt><a href="../../apps/cnt_to_leds_and_rfm/cnt_to_leds_and_rfm.desc">apps/cnt_to_leds_and_rfm.desc</a></tt>
and&nbsp; <tt><a href="../../apps/rfm_to_leds/rfm_to_leds.desc">apps/rfm_to_leds/rfm_to_leds.desc.
</a></tt>When you turn on cnt_to_leds_and_rfm you should see the count
displayed on the rfm_to_leds device.&nbsp; Congratulations&nbsp; you are
doing wireless networking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you change this to provide a
wireless sensor?&nbsp; (hint: SENS_TO_RFM).
