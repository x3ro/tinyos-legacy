<td><b><font size=+1>MICA Platform Design and HW verification tools&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4"><a href="lesson0.html">Lesson 0: Check your install and 
hardware</a></font></b><br>
Lesson 0 walks though the toscheck tool and the mica_hardware_verify 
application.</p>
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson1.html">Lesson 1: An Introduction to
Tiny OS</a></font></b>
<br>Lesson 1 introduces the major concepts required to program Tiny OS
applications. These include a description of components, frames, commands,
and events. The Tiny OS programming model is explained. The role of each
of the different file types are detailed.&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>NEST Sensor Board Design&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson2.html">Lesson 2: Event-driven Sensor
Acquisition</a></font></b>
<br>The Tiny OS platform provides primitives to obtain sensing data from
tiny networked devices. This lesson details how to build a simple sensing
application that records the light exposure on a photo diode.&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson3.html">Lesson 3: Introducing Tasks
for Application Data Processing</a></font></b>
<br>The roles of both tasks and events are described. This lesson illustrates
the use of tasks to process data from the sense application in lesson 2
and events to receive the sensor data and pass it on to the background
running task.&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson4.html">Lesson 4: Composing Components
to Send and Receive Messages</a></font></b>
<br>Lesson 4 introduces basic abstraction to send integers via the RFM
radio stack. A counter application is built that sends the current value
of the counter over the RF radio.&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="tossim-lesson.html">TOSSIM Lesson: Using the
Simulator to Develop TinyOS Components</a></font></b>
<br>TOSSIM is the TinyOS simulator. Learn how to build, debug, and run
components using TOSSIM.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson5.html">Lesson 5: Displaying Data on
a PC</a></font></b>
<br>In order to utilize the data from the tiny networked sensors, we must
be able to analyze it on the host computer. This lesson provides an example
application that graphs the light readings from the sensors over time.&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson6.html">Lesson 6: Broadcasting Packets&nbsp;</a></font></b>
<br>Lesson 6 has three components.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
It shows how to inject packets from a host environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
This is used to drive a simple message-based command interpreter.&nbsp;
A general abstraction is used for sending arbitrary packets over the RFM
radio stack.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
A multihop broadcast application is built that floods the network with
a task to be performed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font size=+1><a href="lesson7.html">Lesson 7: Data Logging Application</a></font></b>
<br>The final lesson provides a fairly complete application for remote
data logging and collection. It also illustrates a simple multihop data
propogation method that allows data to be collected by a central location.&nbsp;
