    <h1>Lesson 5: Displaying Data on a PC</h1>

    <p>
    The goal of this application is to close the loop on communicating
    with the motes and bring the data onto a PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; First
    we'll introduce you to the tools that we have developed for
    communicating between a mote and a PC.&nbsp; We will then use
    these tools to display sensor reading that are coming from a mote
    onto the screen of a computer.&nbsp; The first stage of this will
    be to display the data coming from the mote in a text
    console.&nbsp; We will then extend this to demonstrate the display
    of this data on a graphical interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally we will
    close the communication loop by demonstrating how to send data
    back to the motes.</p>

    <p>
    The program to be run on the motes is <a
    href="../../apps/oscilloscope/">apps/oscilloscope</a>.  The
    application consists of a single module that reads data from the
    ADC and sends out packets of the sensor reading of data channel 1
    to the to the serial port.&nbsp; This application does not
    transmit the data over the radio.&nbsp; However, it would be
    simple to extend it to do so. It is intended to be used with the
    basic sensor board. Once the application is installed, each time
    the yellow LED blinks, a packet will be send to the serial
    port.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the RED led will be turned on when
    the sensor reading is greater that 0x20.&nbsp; In normal lighting,
    you should see the red led on.&nbsp; If you place the mote in
    darkness (very dark) then you&nbsp; should see the red led go
    off.&nbsp; </p>

    <h2> Step one is to simply get the data printed out onto the
    screen...</h2>

    <p>
    The first step to establishing communication between the PC and
    the mote is to connect up your serial port cable to the
    programming boards and to make sure that you have java and
    javax.comm installed.&nbsp; After programming your mote with the
    oscilloscope code, switch to the tools directory and run &quot;make&quot; then
    &quot;java listen COM1&quot; (assuming the mote is programmed into
    COM1).</p>

    <p>
    cd nest/tools<br>
    java listen COM1</p>

    <p>
    The expected output is:</p>

    <font SIZE="2">
    <pre><font face="Courier">listen started

    <p>
    If you do not see the list of port that are available to
    javax.comm, then you have not correctly installed the javax.comm
    package.&nbsp; Please refer to the installation instructions that
    came with that code.&nbsp; If you do not see that data lines
    on&nbsp; your screen, then you may have chosen the wrong COM port
    or the mote may not be correctly connected to the computer.&nbsp;
    If this basic output program does not work, then it will not be
    possible to continue on.</p>

    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <h2>
    Now what are you seeing?</h2>

    <p>
    The application that you are running is simply printing out the
    packets that are coming form the mote.&nbsp; Each data packet that
    comes out of the mote contains several fields of data.&nbsp; They
    include: the source ID, the reading number of the first reading,
    the ADC channel that the data is coming from and 10 sensor
    readings.</p>

    <p>
    Here is the definition of the packet format as the code that places the data 
    into the packet.....</p>

    <h2>
    Starting the SerialForwarder?</h2>

    <p>
    Listen is the most basic way of communicating with the mote.&nbsp;
    It is a program that directly opens the serial port and prints the
    data that it read out to the screen.&nbsp; While you will be able
    to clearly see a changing pattern in the data (try covering and
    uncovering the sensor),&nbsp; it is difficult to visualize the
    sensor readings. </p>

    <p>
    Along with the mote code, we also provide a PC application designed to 
    visualize the data coming from a mote.&nbsp; However to use the GUI, you 
    have to switch over to using our SerialForwarder, a tool that abstracts away 
    the serial port from an application.</p>

    <p>
    To run the serial forwarder, remain in the tools directory and run
    <font face="Courier">&quot;java
    net.tinyos.SerialForwarder.SerialForward&quot; </font> This will
    open up a GUI window and will also display text in the shell that
    started it.&nbsp; Check both locations to make sure that no errors
    occurred.&nbsp; Make sure that it states that the serial port was
    successfully opened.&nbsp; The window should look like...</p>

    <p>
    <img border="0" src="imgs/SerialForwarder.JPG" width="640" height="512"></p>

    <p>
    As packets arrive from the mote connected to the serial port, you
    will see the &quot;Pckts Read:&quot; field in the lower right
    corner begin to increment.</p>

    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <h2>
    Starting the Oscilloscope GUI</h2>

    <p>
    It is now time to graphically display the data coming from the
    motes.&nbsp; In a new window, return to the tools directory and
    run: java net.tinyos.oscilloscope.oscilloscope.&nbsp; A graphical
    window will popup and begin displaying the data coming from your
    mote.&nbsp; This application is actually connecting to the serial
    forwarder, not directly to you serial port.&nbsp; This allows you
    to simultaneously run other applications that are communicating
    with a mote.</p>

    <p>
    Note, power cycle the mote that is generating the data prior to
    starting the oscilloscope.&nbsp; If the mote has been running for
    a long time, the reading number may be quite large and you may not
    be able to see the data coming from mote on the screen.&nbsp;
    Power cycling the mote will restart the reading counter.&nbsp;
    Alternatively, you could used the scroll and zoom buttons to
    locate the data.</p>

    <p>
    <img border="0" src="imgs/oscilloscope.JPG" width="640" height="603"><br>
    </p>

    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p>
    Here is the code that reads the data from the SerialForwarder</p>

    <p>
    <font face="Courier">public void run() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SerialForwarderStub r = new SerialForwarderStub(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, 
    9000);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r.Open();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r.registerPacketListener(this);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r.Read();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }catch(Exception e){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.printStackTrace();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    }</font></p>

    <p>
    <font face="Times New Roman">The packet Listener interface that must be 
    implemented is:</font></p>

    <p>
    <font face="Courier">public interface PacketListenerIF extends 
    java.util.EventListener {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void packetReceived(byte[] packet);<br>
    }</font></p>

    <p>
    Here the r.Read() function call will never return.&nbsp; Instead
    it will block on waiting for packet to arrive.&nbsp; As the do, it
    will automatically call the &quot;<font face="Courier">public void
    packetReceived(byte[] readings)</font>&quot; function with each
    packet.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>

<h2> Exercise</h2>
    <div align="left">
<p align="left">As written, the oscilloscope program is setup to use the UART 
and the light sensor from the basic sensor board.&nbsp; Instead of using 
oscilloscope use oscilloscope_RF.&nbsp;&nbsp; This version transmits the sensor 
readings over the radio creating a wireless sensing platform.&nbsp; In order to 
use this app, you need to provide a bridge between the mote RF and the serial 
port.&nbsp; With mica nodes, this is done by using generic_base_high_speed.&nbsp; 
Program a second node to be generic_base_high_speed and use it to tie the 
wireless sensor into the SerialForwarder and the oscilloscope GUI.</div>
    
    
    <div align="left">
<p align="left">Next, change the Makefile so that you can use the Mica sensor 
board.</div>
