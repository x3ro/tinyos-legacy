Lesson 3: Introducing Tasks for Application Data Processing</h1>


    <p><br>TinyOS provides a two level scheduling hierarchy consisting
    of tasks and events. TOS events generalize interrupt handling and
    must do only a small amount of work before completing.&nbsp; TOS
    tasks are provided to do any kind of&nbsp; general purpose
    processing, providing concurrency throughout the application
    graph.&nbsp; They may be preempted by events, so real-time
    requirements, such as servicing the radio, may be met while
    processing tasks.

    <p>A <i>TOS task</i> is declared as <tt>void
    TOS_TASK(taskname)()</tt>. It is a lower-level scheduling entity
    than events and may be preempted by events.&nbsp; Tasks execute
    atomically, relative to other tasks.&nbsp; Tasks do not preempt
    task.&nbsp; A task is posted using
    <tt>TOS_POST_TASK(taskname)()</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp; They may be
    posted from within commands, events, or tasks.&nbsp; Tasks may
    not spin or block.&nbsp; They operate on their frame and complete
    their work.&nbsp; Chunks of work separated by long latency
    operations are broken into distinct tasks within a component
    sharing a frame. <p>To illustrate tasks, we have modified the
    SENSE application from lesson 2.&nbsp; It can be found at <a
    href="../../apps/sense2">nest/apps/sense2</a>. We have expanded
    the frame to contain a simple circular data buffer and provided a
    helper function putdata to deposit data into this buffer.


    <blockquote><tt>TOS_FRAME_BEGIN(SENSE_frame) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; char head;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; short data[maxdata];</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>


    <p><br>The data_ready event simply deposits data into the buffer and posts
a task for processing.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>char TOS_EVENT(SENSE_DATA_READY)(short data){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; putdata(data);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; TOS_POST_TASK(processData);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return 1;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Some time after the event completes (there may be other tasks running
as well), the processData task will run.&nbsp; It computes a simple average
and renders it to the display.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>TOS_TASK(processData){</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; int i, sum = 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; TOS_CALL_COMMAND(SENSE_LEDg_toggle)();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; for (i=0; i&lt;maxdata; i++)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum = sum + (VAR(data[i]) >> 7);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; display(sum >> shiftdata);</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
