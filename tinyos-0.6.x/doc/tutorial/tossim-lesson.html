    <h1>TOSSIM Lesson: Using the simulator to develop TinyOS components</h1>
    <h3>TOSSIM, packet injection, packet sniffing, and <tt>dbg</tt></h3>
    
    <br>
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
    <p>TOSSIM is the TinyOS simulator. TOSSIM compiles directly from
    TinyOS code, and is by default automatically compiled (<tt>make
    pc</tt>). TOSSIM has an extensible network, ADC, and spatial model
    interface. The default provided models are very simplistic, but
    the interfaces allow models of significant complexity if needed.</p>

    <p>TOSSIM provides several mechanisms for interacting with the
    network; packet traffic can be monitored, packets can be
    statically or dynamically injected into the network, and TinyOS
    call invocation can be logged.</p>

    <p>Because TinyOS applications run as native code under TOSSIM,
    traditional debugging tools can be used.</p>
    
    <h2> Building and Running the Application </h2>

    <p>TOSSIM is compiled by typing <tt>make pc</tt> in an application
    directory. In addition to the expected TinyOS components, a few
    simulator-specific files are compiled, such as
    <tt>external_comm.c</tt>, which contains the code for
    communicating with the simulator over network sockets.</p>

    <p>Enter the <tt>apps/router/router</tt> directory. This application
    is an example use of a simple beacon-based ad-hoc routing
    algorithm. The program listens for two types of AM messages: type
    5 for beacons and type 6 for data. When a mote hears a beacon, it
    checks to see if it currently has a network parent. If the mote
    does not currently have a parent in the network tree, it makes the
    source of the beacon its parent and retransmits it. If the mote
    has a parent already, it does nothing. After a few system clock
    ticks (currently 8), a mote reverts to a no-parent state.</p>

    <p>When a component tries to send a data message, the routing
    component examines if it currently has a parent. If so, it sends
    the message to it. As the packet travels up the routing tree,
    route information is stored in the packet. A base station can then
    examine this information and see the last few (currently 5) hops
    the packet took, which provides information about the network
    topology.</p>
    
    <p>The code for this algorithm resides in
    <tt>apps/router/shared/AM_ROUTE.c</tt> The
    <tt>apps/router/router</tt> application does not send any data
    messages; it only receives and retransmits beacons. There are
    additional applications in the <tt>apps/router</tt> directory,
    which we will not discuss here.</p>

    <p>In the application directory, type <tt>make pc</tt>. You should
    see the simulator build. The simulator executable lives in the
    <tt>binpc</tt> subdirectory, and is named <tt>main</tt>. Type
    <tt>binpc/main</tt>. You should see a short usage notice with all
    of the simulator run options. Type <tt>binpc/main -h</tt> for a
    more descriptive list:</p>

    <blockquote>
<br><tt>Usage: binpc/main [options] &lt;num_nodes&gt;</tt>

      <tt>Known dbg modes: all, boot, clock, task, sched, sensor, led,
      route, am, crc, packet, encode, radio, logger, adc, i2c, uart,
      prog, sim, queue, simradio, hardware, simmem, usr1, usr2, usr3,
      temp, error, none</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Most of these options are outside the scope of this tutorial;
    they're all discussed in the TOSSIM manual. Right now, the only
    important ones are <tt>-h</tt> and the required argument
    <tt>&lt;num_nodes&gt;</tt>. <p>Try typing "<tt>binpc/main 1</tt>"
    (without the quotes). This will run the simulation with a single
    mote. After the simulator boots (which may take a few moments in
    Cygwin), you'll see a lot of debugging information stream
    by. Typing control-C will stop the simulation. If you look at the
    simulator output, most of it pertains to events and radio clock
    ticks; this is because the radio clock ticks at 20KHz when
    listening for a packet. If you look carefully at the times stated
    for the tick events, you'll see that they're 50 microseconds
    apart. The interval of 200 means 200 clock cycles; since the
    processor is 4MHz, this equal to 50 microseconds. Sample output:

    <blockquote>
      <br><tt>0: Popping event for mote 0 with time 0:0:0.11075450.</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: Setting TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS to 0</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: RADIO: tick event handled for mote 0 at
      0:0:0.11870450 with interval of 200.</tt></br>

      <br><tt>0: mote 0 in state 0</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: RFM: Mote 0 got  bit 0</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: TOS_schedule_task: 0 empty </tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: Popping event for mote 0 with time 0:0:0.11080450.</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: Setting TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS to 0</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: RADIO: tick event handled for mote 0 at
      0:0:0.11875450 with interval of 200.</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: Inserting event with time 0:0:0.11085450.</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: mote 0 in state 0</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: RFM: Mote 0 got  bit 0</tt></br>
      
      <br><tt>0: TOS_schedule_task: 0 empty </tt></br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Time is represented as hours:minutes:seconds. The zero
    preceding each line states which mote is the source of the
    debugging statement; since the simulation only had one mote, this
    is always zero. Run "<tt>binpc/main 2</tt>", and you'll see both
    mote 0 and mote 1 printing output. In the simulator, motes start
    one after another, spaced by a short random period; this is to
    prevent perfect synchronization. Therefore, if you stop the
    simulator very soon after it starts, you might not see any of mote
    1's messages, as it hadn't actually booted yet. Let the simulator
    run for a few seconds and you should see messages from mote 1.</p>

    <h2> Output Configuration </h2>

    <p>If you look at the time values being printed out, the simulator
    is running really slowly; we've been able to simulate 100 motes at
    real life speed (on a Linux desktop) . With so much debugging
    output, almost all of the simulator processing is
    <tt>printf()</tt>. Also, most of the data is usually not
    needed. For example, if you're debugging a packet routing
    algorithm, radio bit events aren't very useful. For this reason,
    you can specify which output messages should be displayed with the
    environment variable <tt>DBG</tt>. When the simulator boots, it
    reads the environment variable and sets which messages will be
    printed and which won't (it's a bit-mask).</p>

    <p>The available debugging modes are at the end of the simulator
    help message:
      
      <blockquote>
       <tt>Known dbg modes: all, boot, clock, task, sched, sensor,
       led, route, am, crc, packet, encode, radio, logger, adc, i2c,
       uart, prog, sim, queue, simradio, hardware, simmem, usr1, usr2,
       usr3, temp, error, none</tt>
      </blockquote></p>

    <p>These modes can be combined by using a comma-delimited
    string. For example, typing "<tt>export DBG=boot,clock</tt>" (in
    <tt>bash</tt>) will enable boot and system clock
    messages. <tt>usr1</tt>, <tt>usr2</tt>, and <tt>usr3</tt> are
    intended for use by applications. Try setting <tt>DBG</tt> to
    <tt>clock,boot</tt> and running the simulator with one mote. You
    can see components being initialized, then system clock interrupts
    being fired twice a second; note the difference in the rate the
    simulator runs at from when radio clock events were being
    displayed. The simulator is compiled with no optimizations by
    default; this is to make debugging easier (optimized code can be
    hard to debug).</p>

    <h2>Injecting Packets into the Network</h2>

    <p>Currently, our simulated motes do very little. The beacon-based
    routing algorithm requires the root of the routing tree to
    generate an initial beacon. However, all motes in TOSSIM run the
    same code image; we need a way to create an initial seed beacon in
    the network. We can do so by using TOSSIM's external communication
    functionality.</p>

    <p>Run the simulator for a single mote with <tt>DBG</tt> set to
    <tt>sim</tt>. You'll see a bunch of messages pertaining to the
    different models (RFM, ADC, etc.), followed by a series of
    messages about connections. These refer to TCP sockets the
    simulator either opens or tries to open on boot. The exact use of
    each of these sockets is described in the TOSSIM user's guide,
    which exists in the <tt>doc/</tt> directory of the release. The
    one we're interested in here is port 10579, which the simulator
    message says is for "dynamic packet injection." Dynamic packet
    injection allows you to connect to the simulator and inject a
    packet into the network as it's running. Static packet injection
    reads in a a series of packets once, at boot, and injects them at
    their specified times. The former is good to poke at your program
    and see its behavior, while the latter is good for repeatable
    results. Keep the simulator running, or if you stopped it, run it
    again.</p>

    <p>There's a Java GUI tool that makes injecting packets into
    TOSSIM fairly easy. Compile
    <tt>net/tinyos/tossim/NetworkInjector.java</tt> and run it. A
    window with two tab panes will pop up. The different tab panes
    refer to different packet types. Don't worry about the BLESS
    packets, which are for a protocol built on top of AM; we want to
    send an AM packet. You can see the four AM fields specified, as
    well as the AM data payload of 32 bytes. (An AM packet is 38
    bytes; two go to the destination, two to the CRC, one to the group
    and one to the type.) The simulator bypasses the CRC check for
    injected messages, so you don't have to calculate the CRC.</p>

    <p>If you recall, <tt>router</tt> uses two AM types: 5 and
    6. Beacon messages are type 5. Change the AM_type field in the
    NetworkInjector to 5, and click the "Inject" button. The simulator
    should say that the incoming packet had a specified time of 0;
    this causes the simulator to make it arrive immediately, which is
    not at time 0. We have our debugging output set to only simulator
    messages; while we can see the packet arrive at the mote, but
    have no idea what happened. Let's take a look at application level
    messages.</p>

    <p>Quit the NetworkInjector, <b>then</b> stop the simulator. It's
    important you do it in this order; otherwise, the TCP port enters
    a waiting state on the OS, and you can't reuse it for a minute or
    so. If you get the order wrong, the simulator will block until it
    can open the server port 10579, retrying every 10 seconds. Change
    your DBG settings to <tt>usr1,sim,am</tt>. Don't run the simulator
    just yet; we want to see what debug messages <tt>usr1</tt> will
    give us.</p>

    <p>Open <tt>AM_ROUTE.c</tt>. Look for <tt>dbg</tt>
    statements. You'll notice they're of the form <tt>dbg(flag,
    (message))</tt>, where <tt>message</tt> is a standard
    <tt>printf(3)</tt> argument list. There are a few statements,
    mostly dealing with the acquisition or rejection of parents from
    beacon messages. The clock event is bound to <tt>usr2</tt>, while
    all the others are bound to <tt>usr1</tt>. A complete list of the
    flags and their DBG environment bindings can be found in
    <tt>tos/include/dbg_modes.h</tt>. Try adding a <tt>DBG_TEMP</tt>
    message at component initialization. Recompile the application,
    set your DBG mode to <tt>temp</tt> and see your message
    appear.</p>

    <p>Since we've set <tt>DBG</tt> to include <tt>usr1</tt>, we
    should see debugging messages associated with that mode. Start up
    the simulator again, then the <tt>NetworkInjector</tt>. Try
    injecting a message of AM type 0 (the default). You'll see the
    simulator output that mote zero received an AM packet, but the
    application component didn't do anything with it; it uses type 5
    for beacons. Change the AM type to 5 and inject again. You should
    see these messages:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <tt>0: got messaged number 5 for dispatch</tt><br>
      <tt>0: route set to 0</tt><br>
      <tt>0: Sending message: ffffffff, 5</tt>
    </blockquote>
		  
    <p>If you look back at <tt>AM_ROUTE.c</tt>, you can see where
    <tt>route set to 0</tt> comes from.</p> Try injecting two packets
    in succession. If a long enough time has passed, the mote should
    have forgotten its parent; the first will set the route, and the
    second will result in a different message:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <tt>0: got messaged number 5 for dispatch</tt><br>
      <tt>0: route already set to 0</tt>
      <tt>0: Sending message: ffffffff, 5</tt>
    </blockquote>
		  
    <p>Since the mote already has a parent, it doesn't pay attention
    to the second message and doesn't transmit a beacon.</p>

    <p>So far, we've only been simulating a single (or a pair) of
    motes. The default simulator settings allow up to a thousand motes
    to be simulated at once. Let's try simulating a small network of
    10 motes. Since the AM messages are lengthy, change your
    <tt>DBG</tt> setting to just <tt>sim,usr1</tt>. Run the simulator
    with ten motes: <tt>binpc/main 10</tt>. Start up the NetworkInjector and
    inject a single type 5 packet. You'll see that mote 0 receives the
    packet, then transmits a beacon. All of the other motes here mote
    0's beacon and make it their parent. The default radio model for
    TOSSIM is a single cell with no bit errors; all motes hear one
    another perfectly. The format of routing beacon messages means
    that sending the default AM message (filled with zeroes) makes
    mote 0 think it's heard itself as a parent; in the real world,
    we'd have a base station which has different logic (knows it's the
    root).</p>

    <h2>Visualizing Network Traffic</h2>
    
    <p>We could turn on AM debugging messages to see the packets being
    sent, but that would obscure other data about what's going
    on. There's a Java GUI tool that allows us to sniff the network
    traffic and see what's being sent. It needs to be started
    <b>before</b> the simulator; the simulator tries to connect to a
    certain port at startup. Compile and run
    <tt>net/tinyos/tossim/TossimGUI.java</tt>.

    <p>TossimGUI visualizes packets that have been <b>sent</b>, not
    received, in the network. The simulator hasn't started, so there
    shouldn't be anything displayed. Start up the simulator with ten
    motes, then the NetworkInjector. Inject a single packet of type
    5. You should see ten messages sent; the first is from mote 0,
    when it sends out its beacon, then one for each of the other nine
    motes. You can see the data being sent in the beacon. Atmel
    processors are little-endian, so the more significant byte comes
    first. Click on the packet that mote 0 sent. You should see the AM
    broadcast address (<tt>0xffff</tt>), followed by the type
    (<tt>0x05</tt>), followed by your local group. The next field in
    the packet is the tree depth. Mote 0 thinks it is at depth 1, so
    the next two bytes are <tt>0x01</tt> and <tt>0x00</tt>. The two
    bytes after that contain the mote's address, which is zero. This
    is more clear on one of the subsequent beacons. For example, if
    you look at the beacon that mote 7 sent, you can see that it's
    depth field says 2. The first address stored is mote 0; the second
    is mote 7 (<tt>0x07 0x00</tt>).</p>

    <p>Try injecting another packet. If the network has timed out, you
    can see the beacon broadcast again; if not, you'll see simulator
    debug messages saying that the motes already have routes set.<p>
      
    <p>This simple radio model doesn't really let us see complex
    behavior; we automatically form a depth 2 tree. The simulator has
    two additional radio models, <tt>static</tt> and
    <tt>space</tt>. We're going to use the former; the latter is just
    a demonstration that a spatial-based connectivity model can be
    implemented with the TOSSIM radio model abstraction.</p>

    <h2>Static Routes</h2>

    <p>The static radio model allows you to specify an undirected
    graph of mote connectivity. As with the simple model, bits are
    perfectly transmitted, and there is no network noise. At startup,
    the simulator tries to read in the file <tt>cells.txt</tt>; if no
    such file exists, it defaults to the simple radio model. The
    format of <tt>cells.txt</tt> is a set of colon-delimited pairs
    A:B. Each pair means that A and B can hear one another. For
    example, a file that looked like this:
      
    <blockquote>
      <tt>0:1 1:2 2:3 3:4 4:5 5:0</tt>
    </blockquote>

    would create a ring of 6 motes. Create this file in
    <tt>apps/router/router/cells.txt</tt>. Start up TossimGUI, then
    the simulator, but specify this option: <tt>-r static</tt> (like
    this: <tt>binpc/main -r static 6</tt>). Inject a beacon packet
    into the network.</p>

    <p>For some reason, mote 3 never transmits a beacon. If you look
    at the simulator output, it never set a route. Why? It's connected
    to mote 4 and 2, both of which sent beacons.</p>

    <p>Mote 3 is victim of the hidden node problem. If you look at the
    timestamps in the packet visualization, you can see that mote 4
    and 2 send their packets very close to one another. Mote 3 is, at
    one point, hearing the union of their bits.</p>

    <p>Quit all the applications (remember: NetworkInjector before
    simulator). Set your <tt>DBG</tt> mode to <tt>usr1,crc</tt>. This
    will provide us with information about the packet-level CRC
    checks. If mote 3 is hearing two packets at once, it's unlikely
    the bytes heard will pass CRC.</p>

    <p>Start up the applications as before, and inject a packet. You
    should see messages similar to:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <tt>0: route set to 0</tt><br>
      <tt>0: CRC: 1132</tt><br>
      <tt>5: route set to 0</tt><br>
      <tt>5: CRC: 37b4</tt><br>
      <tt>1: route set to 0</tt><br>
      <tt>1: CRC: ffffa672</tt><br>
      <tt>2: route set to 1</tt><br>
      <tt>2: CRC: ffffc16b</tt><br>
      <tt>4: route set to 5</tt><br>
      <tt>4: CRC: ffffe2a7</tt><br>
      <tt>1: route already set to 0</tt><br>
      <b><tt>3: crc check failed: ffffa24c, ffffd56b</tt></b><br>
      <tt>5: route already set to 0</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Part of the cause of this is that the random wait before
    transmitting is much shorter than the time it takes to transmit a
    packet at 10Kb. The simulator can also simulate a 25 or 50 Kb
    radio stack; it still uses the <tt>GENERIC_COMM</tt> stack,
    though. This functionality allows you to simulate a high-speed
    mica stack while still using the standard 10Kb stack
    components. At 50Kb, the random wait time overwhelms the
    transmission time. Try running the simulator as so: <tt>binpc/main
    -kb 50 -r static 6</tt>. Inject a beacon packet, and mote 3 can
    associate with the network, because the packets from 2 and 4 are
    spaced out enough in time.</p>
    
    <p>Try changing the topology to a seven mote ring; every mote
    should join the routing tree with a 10Kb stack.</p>
