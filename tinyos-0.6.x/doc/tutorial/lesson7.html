    <h1>Lesson 7: Data logging application</h1>

    <p>
    This tutorial will discuss a fairly complete application for remote data
    logging and collection, called <a href="../../apps/sense_and_log/">
    sense_and_log</a>. This application builds on components from previous
    lessons: <tt>BCAST</tt>, <tt>SENSE</tt> and <tt>COMMAND</tt>.  This
    tutorial also discusses the <tt>LOGGER</tt> component, and shows a simple
    multihop data propagation from the sensors to a central location.</p>

    <h2>Functionality</h2>

    <tt>sense_and_log</tt> application is an example of a more complete data
    collection.  Using broadcasted commands, we can instruct a collection of
    motes to collect a certain number of samples at a chosen rate. This data
    will be stored locally on the mote. It can be later retrieved from the
    network.  

    The high-level functionality of <tt>sense_and_log</tt> can be best
    understood by looking at the <tt>COMMAND</tt> component. The structure of
    this module builds on on the <tt>COMMAND</tt> from <a href="lesson6.html">
    Lesson 6</a>. The <tt>eval_cmd</tt> processing loop now recognizes two
    additional commands: 
    <ul>
      <li>START_SENSING -- this command invokes the <tt>SENSE</tt> component
	to collect a specified number of samples at a specified sampling rate
	and to store these samples in the EEPROM. 
      <li>READ_LOG -- this command will retrieve a block of data from the
	EEPROM and report it over the multihop network to the base station.
	The requests flood the network, whereas the reply travels along a well
	defined path. This also causes a more complex interaction with the
	BCAST component -- if a node detects that it should act on the
	message, it squashes the local re-broadcast.
    </ul>
    
    Since the data is supposed to flow to the origin of the <tt>READ_LOG</tt>
    request, the each node now remembers where the message originated.  We'll
    return to this piece of information when discussing multihop routing. 

    <h2>Sensing</h2>
    
    <p>
    This component builds on the <tt>SENSE</tt> component from <a
    href="lesson2.html"> Lesson 2 </a> and <tt>OSCOPE</tt> component from <a
    href="lesson5.html"> Lesson 5</a>.  In order to start sensing, an upper
    layer needs to invoke the START method, and specify the number of samples
    to be taken, as well as the rate at which they should be taken. </p>

    On each clock tick, the application issues a request to sample the sensor
    (exactly which sensor that might be depends on the description file).
    When the pre-specified number of samples has been collected, the
    application turns off the <tt>CLOCK</tt>:
<pre>void TOS_EVENT(SENSE_CLOCK_EVENT)(){
    VAR(nsamples)--;
    if (VAR(nsamples)== 0) {
	// Stop the clock. 
	TOS_CALL_COMMAND(SENSE_CLOCK_INIT)(0, 255);
    }
    TOS_CALL_COMMAND(SENSE_LEDr_toggle)();
    TOS_CALL_COMMAND(SENSE_GET_DATA)();
}

</pre>
    
    The data ready event deposits the sensor readings into a buffer, much like
    in <tt>OSCOPE</tt>.  When this local buffer fills up, it is written out to
    the <tt>LOGGER</tt>.  The application uses double buffering (much like
    <tt>OSCOPE</tt>), so the constraint is that the LOGGER_APPEND is finished
    before the second buffer fills up.
    
    <h2>Logger component, interfaces, usage, and limitations</h2>

    The Mica mote has an on-board, 4-MB flash EEPROM.  The EEPROM
    serves as a persistent storage device for the mote, and it has proven
    indispensable in many applications involving data collection (both sensor
    data and debugging traces) or network programming.  The <a
    href="../../tos/system/LOGGER.c"> LOGGER</a> component abstracts the
    access to this hardware. It exposes a record-oriented interface, and it
    operates on 16-byte blocks.  It exposes three methods for interacting with
    the EEPROM:
    <ul>
      <li><tt> char APPEND_LOG(char* data);</tt> -- sequential write access,
	useful for storing sensor data or other in-order streams.  Low regions
	of the EEPROM cannot be accessed with APPEND_LOG, which is useful in
	certain applications
      <li><tt>char WRITE_LOG(int line, char* data);</tt> -- random access
	write to the EEPROM, very useful when the size and structure of the
	object stored is known in advance.  This functionality is very useful
	when it comes to network reprogramming. 
      <li><tt>char READ_LOG(int line, char* dest);</tt> -- random access
	read, the component using the log passes in a buffer to be
	written.
    </ul>

    <p>
    All of the above operations are split phase - APPEND_LOG and WRITE_LOG
    will signal a <tt>APPEND_LOG_DONE(char success);</tt> upon completion, and
    READ_LOG will signal <tt>READ_LOG_DONE(char* packet, char
    success);</tt>. Only one of these operations can be performed at a time,
    if there is an operation is progress, the invocation of any of these
    commands will fail.  Applications using the LOGGER must take care to
    either ensure a full serialization of operations or check the command
    return code and retry periodically.</p>

    <p>
    You'll note that both READ_LOG and WRITE_LOG will address the underlying
    EEPROM in units of <em> lines</em>.  Line is analogous to a block number
    on a harddrive -- it addresses the EEPROM not in the units of bytes but
    rather in the units of LOG_ENTRIES. With the 16 LOG_ENTRIES, the log will
    store 2048 log lines</p>

    <p>
      <em> Note on internal storage organization:</em> The APPEND_LOG command
      from this release of LOGGER will not write any data to lines 0 through
      3. This region of EEPROM has been set aside to store data persistent to
      the mote. If you're using network reprogramming components, this region
      will hold the TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS for the mote, which will make it
      persistent across reprogramming. Also when using network programming,
      you may wish to set aside a larger buffer for the downloaded code, or
      otherwise gurantee that logging of other data will not interfere with
      downloaded code. </p>

    <p>
      <em> Note on tossim:</em> At this point there is no functionality of
      logger in the tossim, so applications using the logger cannot be
      reliably simulated under tossim.</p>

    <h3> Logging performance</h3>
    
    <p>
    Another issue that comes up quite often is the performance of the
    logger. Read performance is proportional to the amount of data being read,
    and is fast enough not to be a problem in most TinyOS applications.  The
    write speed is a different issue. Since the write speed is slower than the
    maximum data generation of the mote, it is the logger component that
    effectively limits the capture rate. The write speed is proportional to
    the amount of data being written, but after every log entry write there is
    a pause of about 5 ms. During that pause, the EEPROM transfers the data
    from an internal RAM buffer into nonvolatile storage. During that time,
    the EEPROM is completely nonresponsive.  It is that internal EEPROM buffer
    that limits the maximum size for EEPROM log entries to 64 bytes.  Moving
    to larger EEPROM entries will have the effect of increasing the throughput
    of the EEPROM.  For the LOGGER in the release, we chose log entries of 16
    bytes, as a reasonable compromise between logging performance, buffering
    requirements, and interactions between the logging components and the
    messaging subsystem. </p>

    <p>
    As a rule of thumb, you should assume that writing a log entry to the
    EEPROM will take about 10 ms. This implies the logging throughput at 1600
    bytes per second. If you're trying to use the EEPROM to log data from an
    analog sensor attached to the mote, then you can log data at up to 800
    samples per second.  When you exploit the fact that the ADC on the mote
    only produces 10 bits of data per sample, then you can log up to 1280
    samples per second. At the maximum throughput, the mote is able to record
    about 20 seconds worth of data.</p>

    <h2> Multihop data collection</h2> 
    
    As we mentioned above, this application adopts a pull model for extracting
    the data: someone must ask for a specific piece of recorded data from a
    mote. This request is flooded out. The reply travels the path reverse of
    the request path. The following code inside the <tt> COMMAND</tt>
    component accomplishes this:
<pre>// Log message structure
typedef struct {
    short source; 
    short address;
    char log[16];
    unsigned hop_count;
} logmsg_t;

#define TOS_FRAME_TYPE COMMAND_obj_frame
TOS_FRAME_BEGIN(COMMAND_obj_frame) {
    TOS_MsgPtr msg;
    TOS_Msg log_msg;
    short parent;
    char send_pending;
    char pending;
}
TOS_FRAME_END(COMMAND_obj_frame);

...
TOS_TASK(eval_cmd) {
    cmdmsg_t * cmd = (cmdmsg_t *) VAR(msg)->data;
    char status = BCAST_FORWARD;
    // do local packet modifications: update the hop count and packet source
    cmd->hop_count++;
    VAR(parent) = cmd->source;
    cmd->source = TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS;

    switch (cmd->action) {

    case READ_LOG:
	//Check if the message is meant for us, if so issue a split phase call
	//to the logger
	if ((cmd->args.rl_args.address == TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS) &&
	    (VAR(send_pending) == 0)) {
	    if (TOS_CALL_COMMAND(COMMAND_READ_LOG)
		(cmd->args.rl_args.logLine, 
		 ((logmsg_t*) VAR(log_msg).data)->log)) {
		VAR(pending) ++;
	    }
	    status = BCAST_PRUNE;
	}
	break;
    }

....

}

// The log has completed the reading, and now we're ready to send out this
// message. Note a potential problem: what is send_pending set to? 

char TOS_EVENT(COMMAND_READ_LOG_DONE)(char* packet, char success) {
    if (success) {
	VAR(pending) = 0;
	VAR(send_pending) = TOS_CALL_COMMAND(COMMAND_SUB_SEND_MSG)
	    (VAR(parent), AM_MSG(LOG_MSG), &VAR(log_msg));
    }
    return 1;
}

// Routing handler for the LOG_MSG. The default handler is very simple: we
// copy the data out of the packet into the log buffer, and forward it to the
// parent. Exercise to the reader: what are the rece conditions in routing and
// how can they be fixed? 

TOS_MsgPtr TOS_MSG_EVENT(LOG_MSG)(TOS_MsgPtr msg) {
    char i;
    char *ptr1, *ptr2;
    if (VAR(send_pending) == 0) {
	VAR(send_pending) = 1;
	ptr1 = (char *) &(VAR(log_msg));
	ptr2 = (char *) msg;
	for (i =0; i < defaultMsgSize(msg); i++) {
	    *ptr1++ = *ptr2++;
	}
	if (TOS_CALL_COMMAND(COMMAND_SUB_SEND_MSG)
	    (VAR(parent), AM_MSG(LOG_MSG), &VAR(log_msg)) == 0) {
	    VAR(send_pending) = 0;
	}

    }
    return msg;
}

</pre>
    
    <p>
    When any broadcast request is received, each node stores the ID of the
    node that forwarded that request.  When a node composes the log message,
    it forwards it just to the parent node (unlike broadcast, which sends out
    the message to the entire neighborhood).  The parent of the originating
    mote forwards such messages to its parent, until the message reaches the
    source of the request flood. </p>

    <p>
    Mote IDs fullfill two important roles: they help us identify a specific
    data stream, and they are used to identify a specific path through the
    network.  There are schemes, like directed diffusion, which do not use the
    mote IDs for identifying network paths; looking at the <tt>
    TOS_MSG_EVENT(LOG_MSG)</tt>, we could have used a schemes which are more
    in the spirit of diffusion, e.g. the reply could have been flooded back to
    the requester.</p>

    <p>
    Also note that the buffer management in the <tt>LOG_MSG</tt> handler is a
    bit different from what you've seen so far: rather than playing the
    pointer swapping game (like <tt>BCAST</tt>), the message being forwarded
    is copied to the local buffer, and the original buffer is returned to the
    communication stack.</p>
    
    <h2> PC-side tools</h2>
    
    <h2> Exercise </h2> 
    
    Build one mote with <tt>generic_base</tt>. Install <tt>sense_and_log</tt>
    on your remaining motes, taking care  to assign different ids to each
    mote.  Then test out the application:
    
<pre>java net.tinyos.tools.BcastInject groupID START_SENSING 128 4 128
</pre>

    This will instruct the motes to collect 128 light samples at 8 samples per
    second.  Manipulate the conditions so that the light levels change during
    the sampling. Then, extract the data with 
<pre> 
java net.tinyos.tools.BcastInject groupID READ_LOG moteID 4
</pre> 

    You should see a packet reporting the light readings for the first second
    of measurements from mote moteID.
