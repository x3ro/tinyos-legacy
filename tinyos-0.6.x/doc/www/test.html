This is the standard procedure for testing TinyOS on Windows. The tests are
designed to ferret both installation problems and TinyOS bugs. If you 
have problems with any of these steps, please consult the TinyOS FAQ at

TOSROOT is defined to be the parent directory of the tos source
tree. That is, if nest were in c:\nest, then c: would be TOSROOT. On
Unix, if the src were in /usr/local/src/nest, then TOSROOT would be
/usr/local/src.

Any '$' prompt in examples below symbolizes a cygwin shell prompt.

1.  toscheck. 
toscheck is a perl script distributed with the TinyOS source and is found
in TOSROOT/nest/tools. After a successful installation, toscheck
should complete with no errors or warnings.  

Run toscheck like this:

   $ cd nest/tools
   $ toscheck

You should see no errors or warnings.  

2. cnt_to_leds. 
Connect the mote to a programming board. Connect the programming board's 
parallel port to your machine's parallel port. Ensure that the
switch is toward the 'Big Guy' label. Turn the mote's power on.

In your nest src tree, do this:

$ cd nest/apps/cnt_to_leds
$ make mica
$ make mica install

Ensure that all three leds are blinking in such a manner that they
count to 7 in binary.

The values corresponding to the leds are: 

Yellow: 2^0
Green:  2^1
Red:    2^2

Accordingly, they turn on in this order:

(1) Yellow 
(2) Green 
(3) Yellow AND Green 
(4) Red    
(5) Yellow AND Red 
(6) Green AND Red 
(7) Yellow AND Green AND Red 

If you watch a couple cycles, the pattern becomes clearer. 

3. listen.java
In your nest src tree, do this:

   $ cd nest/tools
   $ javac listen.java
   $ java listen COM1

You should see this output:
listen started
printing all ports...
-  COM3
-  COM1
-  LPT1
-  LPT2
done.

If you do not see the specific ports listed (COM*, LPT*, etc.), there
is likely something wrong with the javax.comm installation.

4. oscilloscope application 
Connect the mote's parallel port to your machine. Ensure that the
switch is toward the 'Big Guy' label. Turn the mote's power on.

In your nest src tree, do this:

   $ cd nest/apps/oscilloscope
   $ make mica
   $ make mica install

The red and yellow leds should be lit. The yellow light blinks, the
red light is steady.

Remove the mote from the parallel port and place it in your serial port.

Run the 'listen' tool (see step 3).

You should see output like this:

listen started
printing all ports...
-  COM3
-  COM1
-  LPT1
-  LPT2
done.
baud rate: 9600

7e 0 a 7d 1 0 68 1 1 0 .....
7e 0 a 7d 1 0 68 1 1 0 .....
.
.


5. java SerialForwarder
Install the oscilloscope app on your mote if it isn't installed
already (see the first part of step 3 above).  Seat the mote it in
your serial port.

Make the SerialForward gui app:

   $ cd nest/tools
   $ make
   $ java net/tinyos/SerialForwarder/SerialForward
 
A gui pops up. In the lower right-hand corner, you should see the
'Pckts Read' count steadily increasing.


6. Java Oscilloscope GUI
With the applications started in step 4 running, start a second Cygwin
shell and do the following:

   $ cd nest/tools
   $ java net/tinyos/oscilloscope/oscilloscope

You will also see lines of numbers streaming in the shell window. A
gui will pop up. There should be a green line graphing data read from
the Mote.

Place your hand over the light sensor on the sensor board. You should
see the green line dip and then recover when you remove your hand.
