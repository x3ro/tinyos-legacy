 * This component implements a Beacon-LESS ad-hoc routing protocol. The
 * nodes automatically construct a routing tree rooted at a base station.
 * Route determination is based on hops from the base station; nodes try
 * to minimize the number of hops. Hop-count information is included in
 * every data message sent. By looking at other node's traffic, nodes can
 * determine if there is a shorter route. The tree is bootstrapped by
 * periodic empty data messages sent by the base station to itself with a
 * hop count of zero. BLESS.c contains greater details.
 *
 * BLESS_ACTIVE returns whether the mote has a parent, and so whether
 * its networking is active (will send).
