
This program is an extension of gdi-norf.  However, when this program
wakes up, it ATTEMPTS to (1) make three ADC measurements, (2) blinks
the leds, (3) send a broadcast message, and (4) return to sleep.

Unfortunately, this is incompatible with the radio stack.
The stack and power management components need fixing.
