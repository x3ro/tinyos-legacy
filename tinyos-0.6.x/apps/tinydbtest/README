About the Tuple Router
---------------------

The tuple router receives queries and tuples.  When a query arrives, it
converts it to a ParsedQuery.  When a tuple arrives, it routes it, along with
an expression and some expression state, to the appropriate operators.

When a operator outputs a tuple, it routes it to the next operator in the
expression list, or sends it up the routing tree to be output.

About Queries
--------------

Queries consist of a named list of fields and a set of expressions over those
fields.  Queries are parsed into ParsedQueries, consist of a list of local 
schema fields corresponding to the named fields into the original query, as well
as the same set of expressions.  Named fields that do not exist in the local
schema are marked as null in the parsed query data structure.
