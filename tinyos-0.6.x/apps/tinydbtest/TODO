x Forward queries to neighbors
x Implement network stubs (sending values to parents, queries to neighbors)
  - Implement parent / child tracking
x Clear aggregation state after each epoch
- Don't always transmit at beginning of next epoch -- transmit sometime during
  next epoch
- Child value cache
- Holistic aggregates
- subqueries (e.g. max of average) -- allow aggregates to access local cache of values

known bugs:

? can't DELETE queries
  - not tested
- Delivery rate = 1, results appear to be empty? (get reset?)
? query id != 0 doesn't work (qid always 0 in aggregate results?)
  - fix not verified
