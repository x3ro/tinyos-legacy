board.

basic_db_mote.desc: Describes a minimum-functionality schema-equipped mote
which can respond to the schema messages and report sensor readings.

basic_db_mote_acc.c: The accessor functions to report readings for
the sensors on this mote.  These functions are linked in basic_db_mote.desc
to report when sensor data is ready -- the functions to retrieve sensor
data are automatically generated in ACCESSORS.c (which is produced by the
parseschema tool).
