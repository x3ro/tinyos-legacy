 *
 * This module is a demonstration of the logging functionality.  It 
 * periodically reads in sensor values.  Once it has a full data packet of
 * sensor readings, it writes the data out to a Log Entry.  The LOGGER
 * componnet automatically appends the entry to the log.  When the log
 * write is complete, the applications sends the same data to the UART.
 *
 * This component also acceps message commands that will cause it to read
 * from the log.  The first two bytes are interpreted a log entry number.  
 * The module reads the values out of the log and then broadcasts them  
 * over the radio.
 * 
 * The log entries are 16 bytes long.  They are stored in the I2C EEPROM
 * which has a capacity of 256 Kbits.
