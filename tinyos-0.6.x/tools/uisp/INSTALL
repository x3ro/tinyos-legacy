
Micro In-System Programmer Brief Installation Notes


Enter the src directory.

If uisp does not compile successfully, add switch -DNO_DIRECT_IO in the
Makefile to remove support for direct I/O port access (that may be
necessary on non-PC architectures).  Parallel port access should still
work if you have the Linux ppdev driver (patch for 2.2.17 is in the
kernel directory, ppdev is standard in 2.4 kernels).  Please lobby
Alan Cox to include this tiny little driver in 2.2.x too :).

Win32 users must have the cygwin tools installed.

To make it type:

	make

and to install it:

	make install

----------------------------------------
Win32 installation

Windows platforms require the GiveIO driver for uisp to work correctly. 

Enter the kernel/win32 directory.

Type:

	make

followed by:

	make install 

(WindowsNT/Windows2000/WindowsXP users must have administrative privileges to 
install driver)


Then follow the directions above to install uisp.
