
 - improve pavr support (many thanks to Jason Kyle for sending me one
   of these nice programmers, see http://avr.jpk.co.nz/pavr/pavr.html):
   - add option to force device type for chips with broken signature bytes
   - use consistent -dpart=... device names
   - more firmware improvements, speed optimizations (send OK response
     and receive the next command while executing the previous one, use
     data polling if supported by device, etc.)
 - test/improve/fix ATmega8/16/323/128 support (datasheets now available!)
 - support for parallel port JTAG programming of ATmega8/16/323/128
 - AT89S52 support (similar commands as AVR, but RESET active high)
 - option to generate XTAL1 clock for target device while programming,
   as in FBPRG / AVREAL / modified ByteBlaster / STK200 (LED output)
 - how to talk to these new USB programmers Kanda is advertising now?
 - better documentation
 - clean rewrite in C ;)
   (for parallel port interfaces only, maybe port the program already
   available at http://www.bsdhome.com/avrprog/ from FreeBSD to Linux
   and extend it to support all these different cables?)
   or at least, some better way to add all these parallel interfaces
   invented by various people, with different pin assignments.
 - better portability (no longer Linux-only), add autoconf/automake?
