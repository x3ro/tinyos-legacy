<h1>The 6.1 Communications Stack</h1>

<p>The 6.1 commStack was created to address issues with matlab's serial port 
interactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading from serial ports in Matlab R12 was quite 
slow.&nbsp; Furthermore, the names of serial port properties between matlab 12.0 
and 12.1 were different, making it difficult to have a single comm stack that 
everybody could use.&nbsp; Finally, the biggest problem was that parsing the 
byte stream was quite slow.</p>

<p>To remedy these issues, a new comm stack was created in which the data layer 
was implemented in Java.&nbsp; this solves all three issues described above.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, a MatlabTimer object was created in Java that signals clock events 
with a given frequency, allowing clock driven applications instead of data 
driven apps (this was not previously possible because matlab is single threaded 
and so cannot have a seperate clock thread driving the main app).&nbsp; The only 
disadvantage of using the 6.1 comm stack is that you need to add the new java 
classes to the matlab classpath.</p>

<p>This is done by typing &quot;edit classpath.txt&quot; in your matlab command window and 
adding the line &quot;C:/nest/tools&quot; or whatever the path to your nest/tools/matlab 
directory is.&nbsp; That's all you need to do.&nbsp; The rest of this document 
simply describes the semantics of the new java data layer.</p>

<p><font size="2">(Note that if you want to continue using the old comm stack, 
which was developed for Matlab R12, you can simply use the old version of 
nest/tools/matlab/defineTOSenvironment.m, which declares the old commStack to be 
the default.&nbsp; If you want to use the old comm stack with Matlab R12.1, 
there are a few places where you need to change the names of the elements 
BytesReceivedAction to BytesReceivedFcn.)</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The New Data Layer</h3>

<p>To use the matlabDataPort just use the command:</p>

<p>p = net.tinyos.matlab.MatlabDataPort('Name of the port', 'host', port, 
desired, 0)</p>

<p>where port is an integer and desired is one of two values:</p>

<p>net.tinyos.matlab.MatlabDataPort.MOST_RECENT_PACKETS<br>
net.tinyos.matlab.MatlabDataPort.LAST_UNSEEN_PACKETS</p>

<p>these two constants basically switch the port between reliable and unreliable 
mode.&nbsp; If you are only sampling from the data stream, you will want to use 
unreliable data ports.</p>

<p>After creating the Dataport, you can call the following commands, too:</p>

<p>p.setMaxBufferSize(int)</p>

<p>p.setPacketsDesired(see above)</p>

<p>p.write(bytes)</p>

<h3>The MatlabTimer</h3>

<p>To use the matlab timer, run the command</p>

<p>c = net.tinyos.matlab.MatlabClock('my function description', 'myFunction', 
period(ms), 1)</p>

<p>then, a java window will pop up that lets you call &quot;my function&quot; whenever you 
want and with whatever period you want.</p>
