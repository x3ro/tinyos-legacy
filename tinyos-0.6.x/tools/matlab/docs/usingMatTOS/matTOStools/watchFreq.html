<h1>watchFreq</h1>
<p>Watch freq plots a histogram of the data arriving from the serial port.&nbsp; 
This is useful for seeing the frequency with which different values are 
arriving.&nbsp; For example, the default field that is being watched is 'moteID', 
so you can see the frequency with which you are hearing each mote.&nbsp; You 
might also want to use it to characterize the noise in your signal or to find a 
probability distribution over your signal.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is otherwise exactly 
the same as the other two watch tools.</p>
