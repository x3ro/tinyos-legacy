<h1>watchSurface</h1>
<p><i>watchSurface </i>will plot data over <i>space </i>from all packets coming 
from a particular set of motes or from a particular set of serial ports.&nbsp; 
Unlike <i>watch</i>, <i>watchSurface </i>throws away all data from the past.&nbsp; 
It knows where each mote is located and plots the last data point from each mote 
in the correct location.&nbsp; These points form a surface in space.&nbsp; To 
start <i>watchSurface</i>, make sure that the motes you want to listen to are <i>
mapped </i>to both a <i>packetPort </i>and a <i>location </i>in your
<a href="../applicationEnvironment.html">environment</a>.&nbsp; Then, to watch 
data from motes 1, 5, 101 and 34,just type</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">h= watchSurface([1 5 101 34])</font></p>
<p>or, if you want to listen to all packets on a particular port, for example 
COM1 and COM2,type</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">h=watchSurface(getPacketPorts({'COM1', 'COM2'}))</font></p>
<p>or if you want to listen to all ports and all motes:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">h=watch('all')</font></p>
<p>The return value 'h' is a handle to the plot that was created.&nbsp; Make 
sure that the motes you are watching are not colinear or you will get errors 
when drawing a surface.&nbsp; As long as you have packets coming in that have a 
field called '<i>samples</i>', you should get output that looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <i>oscope </i>application has a '<i>samples</i>' field, so watch works 
with packets coming from mores running <i>oscope </i>or <i>generic sensor</i>.&nbsp; 
But what if I don't want to watch the '<i>samples</i>' field, I want to watch a 
different field?&nbsp; You can set the field to be plot using the following 
command:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">setWatchSurfaceFieldName('lightReadings')</font></p>
<p>Another thing you might want to do is filter your data before plotting it.&nbsp; 
For example, if you are plotting light readings you might not want to plot <i>
all </i>the readings that come in on each packet, you might want to print the 
average of all light readings in each packet.&nbsp; You can use the following 
command:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">setWatchSurfaceFilterName('mean')</font></p>
<p>To do exactly that.&nbsp; The default filter is to take the last data point.&nbsp;
<i>WatchSurface </i>will now plot the mean of your data in each packet instead 
of the last data point.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also write more sophisticated 
filters and use those.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After you run <i>watchSurface </i>for a while, you might like what you see 
and what to access the data that was just plotted.&nbsp; You can do that with 
the following command:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">[myXData,myYData,myZData] =get(h,'XData','YData','ZData')</font></p>
<p>where 'h' is the&nbsp; handle returned by the command <i>watch.</i></p>
<p>If watchSurface is running too slow and you need to decrease the resolution 
or if you want to increase the resolution to make it look better, you can use 
the following command</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">setWatchSurfaceResolution(10) </font></p>
<p>The default is 10, which means that the interpolated surface with be a 10 by 
10 grid.</p>
<p>You may also want to plot the actual data points on the screen instead of 
just looking at the interpolated surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can do that with this 
command:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">setWatchSurfaceDrawPoints(1)</font></p>
<p>That command toggles watchSurface to draw the true data points or not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Just as in watch, you can change the method that adds the data to watch.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">setWatchSurfaceAddMethod('myFunction')</font></p>
<p>The default add method is called <i>addDataToWatchSurface</i>.&nbsp; This is 
especially useful if you change the global variable WATCH_SURFACE_PLOT_FUNCTION 
before running watch.&nbsp; WATCH_SURFACE_PLOT_FUNCTION is default set to '<i>surfc</i>' 
which should plot both a surface and a contour.&nbsp; However, you may want to 
use '<i>surf</i>' or 'mesh' or 'contour' instead, or even 'plot3' or some other 
function.&nbsp; If you do, you may or may not have to write your own add method.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to change the drawing style of your <i>watchSurface </i>
plot, you can pass it the same parameters you would pass a SURF command in 
matlab.&nbsp; You can also use the HOLD, AXIS, LEGEND and other commands that 
you can use with PLOT.</p>
<p>Note that watchSurface does not yet have filters for mote IDs, group IDs, or 
AM types.&nbsp; It also does not yet support reading from multiple data 
channels.</p>
