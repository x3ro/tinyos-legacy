<h1>Speeding it up</h1>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why your app might be running slowly.&nbsp; 
Here are a few tips to make it run faster:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Vectorize your code.&nbsp; See the mathworks help and documentation 
in both the help files and online.&nbsp; Vectorizing your code (using matrix or 
array commands instead of for loops) is at least 15 times faster.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In general, use matlab commands whenever possible instead of your 
own code, especially when you are about to introduce a for loop. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Raise the number of packets that are being read in at a time using 
the <font face="Courier New">setDataPortBufferSizes(10)</font> command.&nbsp; 
The higher the number, the faster it should run.&nbsp; See
<a href="../usingMatTOS/applicationEnvironment.html">environments</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Minimize screen printing and graphing.&nbsp; This is incredibly 
slow.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Use the <i>profile </i>command to find out which of your functions 
are taking all the time.&nbsp; Read about it in the help files.&nbsp; It tells 
you which functions are taking exactly what percentage of CPU time and gives you 
plots, etc.</p>
