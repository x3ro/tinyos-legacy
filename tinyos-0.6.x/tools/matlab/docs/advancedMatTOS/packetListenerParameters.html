<h1>Passing Parameters to Packet Listeners</h1>
<p>When registering a function of yours as a packet listener, you can send a 
parameter to the function each time, along with the packet, in the following 
way:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">addPacketListener(packetPort, {'myfunction', x})</font></p>
<p>In this case, x is some parameter that you want to pass.&nbsp; </p>
<p>X will not change at all ever because it is always passed by reference.&nbsp; 
However, if you make it an object, you could make it a wrapper around a database 
of persistent global variables.&nbsp; To see how to do this, see how I 
implemented the packetPort class.&nbsp; Doing this would allow you to send a 
different parameter to a function each time a packet is received from a 
different mote.</p>
