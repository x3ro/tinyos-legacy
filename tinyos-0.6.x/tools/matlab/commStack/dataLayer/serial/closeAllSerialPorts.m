function closeAllSerialPorts()
%closeAllSerialPorts()
%
%This function closes all serial ports
%that are defined in the TOS environment.
%
%it is useful because otherwise you get an error
%when you try to redefine the tos environment from scratch.
%
%note that once you clear the handle to a serial port object
%there is no way to close it (as far as I know).
