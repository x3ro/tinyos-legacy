Calibrate.java

Class to interface to the calibration component running on a mote
connected to the serial port.  See apps/calib_test/CALIBRATION.c --
motes must include this component to take advantage of this tool.

Displays a text menu and allows calibration information to be
downloaded into the mote, the mote to be queried for calibration data,
and interpolation to be performed on the currently stored calibration
values.

Uses AMInterface to communicate with motes.
