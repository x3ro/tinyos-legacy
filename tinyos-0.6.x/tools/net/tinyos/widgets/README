Package: net.tinyos.widgets
Description: Provides a GUI which periodically displays a scaled value of the baseband 
	     signal strength of the radio.

The program expects a stream of packets from the standard input with each 
byte in the packet represented as hex values, separated by the ',' character.
The normal tools/listen.c can be used to generate such input format.
The output displays a bar graph representing the signal strength value.

Executable:  net.tinyos.widgets.SignalStrength

usage:  ./listen | java net/tinyos/widgets/SignalStrength l h

	where l and h are the positions of the low and high byte of the signal strength
	value in the packet.

	For example, if the signal strength value inside the packet is at byte 5 and 6,
	where byte 5 is the lower 8 bit of the signal strength value, then we run the 
	program wit the following command line:

	./listen | java net/tinyos/widgets/SignalStrength 5 6

Classes:

SignalStrength.java	process incoming packet streams from standard input and extract
	                the signal strength value from the format.

Proximity.java          scales and displays the signal strength value on the GUI
