/**************** MOTE SETUP ********************/

to run the static mote configuration program
java net.tinyos.viz.setup
From the menu, choose configuration, then new
Enter a configuration name, and then EITHER enter a width and height of
        a blank image (in pixels) and hit "OK", OR hit "Select" to pick
        an image from your filesystem
A new window pops up with a blank image of the given size or the image you
        provided. Here you're supposed to provide calibration information.
        Quick info to get through this screen: select the top left corner
          of the image (get a green dot) and enter 0 and 0 in the two
          textfields next to MIN. Select the MAX button, select the bottom
          right corner of the image (get a red dot) and enter 400 and 400
          in the textfields next to MAX, hit OK

        Only read this next bit if you want more details
        Pick a minimum point for the image (click anywhere on the image)
          and assign it an x,y coord. (integers only)
        Click on the MAX radio button, pick a maximum point for the image
          and assign it an x,y coord (integers only)
        This is intended to let you set up a new coordinate system if you
          so desire.
        If you click the right mouse button on the image and drag, you can
          zoom in and out.
        If you select the "Pan" button, the left mouse button lets you drag
          the image around. Select the "Set" button to pick min and max
          points.
        Sample data might be: select the top left hand point and assign it
          0 0; select the bottom right hand point and assign it 400 400;
        Select "OK" to continue

Last window: here's where you populate the space with motes
        click on the image, a box will pop up where you give it an integer id
        repeat until you don't want any more motes
        If you want to delete a mote, click on the R button and then click on
        the mote you want to delete.
        Click on A to go back to adding motes

Once you're done, click on configuration and then click save. This saves the
information to the database.

/**************** ENV/ROUTING VIZ ********************/

to run the environment/routing visualization
cd into viz\sensor (only because the figure it loads needs to be in the
        current directory
to run with fake data: java net.tinyos.viz.sensor.Environment
to run with real data: edit Environment.java and set HAVE_DB flag to TRUE,
        compile it, and then run: java net.tinyos.viz.sensor.Environment

/**************** END ENV/ROUTING VIZ ********************/

/**************** PERSON TRACKER VIZ ********************/

to run with fake data: java net.tinyos.viz.PersonTracker
from the menu, select configuration, then load
Load the configuration you've previously set up - takes a little time
        (30s on my laptop, 3 seconds on my desktop) to get ready

to run with real data: edit viz\PersonTracker.java and set HAVE_DB to TRUE,
        compile it, and then run: java net.tinyos.viz.PersonTracker
This assumes you have entered mobile motes with David's tool or populated
the mobilemote table manually with id/name info.

For PersonTracker, the right mouse button zooms (press it down and drag to
        the right to zoom in and to the left to zoom out) If you select the
        P icon from the toolbar, then the left mouse button pans the image.

from the menu, select configuration, then load
Load the configuration you've previously set up - takes a little time
        (30s on my laptop, 3 seconds on my desktop) to get ready

        compile it, and then run: java viz.SocialNetwork
This assumes you have entered mobile motes with David's tool or populated
the mobilemote table manually with id/name info.

For SocialNetwork, the right mouse button zooms (press it down and drag to
        the right to zoom in and to the left to zoom out) If you select the
