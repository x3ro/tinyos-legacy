Package: net.tinyos.tools
Description: Simple java tools for interacting with motes.
Author: TinyOS team

This package contains small applications that allow a user to interact
with motes in a simple way. For example, applications that print out
what data a mote is sending out over the UART belong here, as well as
simple message injection programs.

Executables: BcastInject, ForwarderListen

net.tinyos.tools.BcastInject
        usage: java net.tinyos.packet.AMPacket [addr port] group_id command

        descr: Given the internet address and port of a
        SerialForwarder process, inject a broadcast packet with the
        specified group_id and command. Command is one of:
               o yellow_led_on
               o yellow_led_off
               o green_led_on
               o green_led_off
               o red_led_on
               o red_led_off
               o radio_quieter
               o radio_louder

net.tinyos.tools.ForwarderListen <addr> <port> [msg-len (default 36)]
	usage: java.net.tinyos.tools.ForwarderListen

        descr: Connects to a SerialForwarder and prints out data
        received by that forwarder on the serial port, printing it to
        standard out.

Test Programs: None


Classes:

BcastInject.java:

Implements the broadcast injection application.

ForwarderListen:

Implements the application that listens to UART data received by a
SerialForwarder.
