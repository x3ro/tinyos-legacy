Mote Schema GUI Tool HOWTO (mikechen@cs.berkeley.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------

This doc describes Sam Madden's GUI tool, MoteDBGUI, of the schema package.
 
1. compile generic_base and attatch it to the serial port.

2. compile some basic_db_motes, each with a unique ID (set in system/main.c, to be fixed)

3. compile MoteDBGUI and starts it (e.g. java MoteDBGUI COM1). 
it writes queries to be sent out by the BS, and the motes
reply with their schema and data readings.
