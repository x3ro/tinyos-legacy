The purpose of this test today is to implement power conservation in the 
IntrusionDetection Mote.

Testing will be done on 4/28/2006

Here is what I want to test:

--Power conservation with the use of HPLPowerManagementM.
	-- I will try to find out the pros and cons of turning power off in 
		between radio Transmissions
	-- I will then work on turning off the power in between taking samples.
		-- I am sampling
