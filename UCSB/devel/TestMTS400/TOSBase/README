README for TOSBase
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

TOSBase is an application that acts as a simple bridge between the
serial and wireless channel. It is similar to the older GenericBase, 
but incorporates FramerM. TOSBase does not use FramerAckM, but 
implements it's own ACK handling. Specifically, TOSBase will only 
ACK a packet received from the serial channel once it has been 
transmitted over the radio. TOSBase will only bridge those packets 
whose group id matches the value of the TOS_AM_GROUP value compiled 
into the application

The LEDS are programmed to toggle as follows:

RED Toggle     - Packet Rcvd over the serial (UART) channel
GREEN Toggle   - Packet Rcvd over the wireless channel
YELLOW Toggle  - Sent an ACK back to the serial channel
