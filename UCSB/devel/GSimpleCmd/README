README for SimpleCmd and Bcast
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

This directory contains two Tiny OS applications: SimpleCmd and Bcast.

SimpleCmd --- handles AM message type 8. This type of message is typically
a command from  a PC that is connected to the base station. 
Currently SimpleCmd only support command 4 commands:
	led_on --- turn the yellow LED on 
        led_off -- turn the yellow LED off
        radio_quieter --- decrease the input to RFM.
        radio_louder  --- increate the input to RFM

Bcast --- can process a command as  SimpleCmd does and forward 
          a new command over RFM to other motes.

This application is part of Tiny OS tutorial.

Tools:

net.tinyos.sf.SerialForward
net.tinyos.tools.BcastInject

These PC tools are used to inject a Am message wich contains a 
command to the SimpleCmd module

Known bugs/limitations:

Only 4 commands as described above are supported.
