There are a couple important setup parameters in using CotsBots that you
should read first before doing any CotsBots programming.

    Programming the MotorBoard</FONT> 
      </B></NOBR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>

Several things have changed since the MotorBoard was last programmed, so
it is important to do this first.  The MotorBoard uses the ATmega8L
microcontroller, a relatively recent addition to the Atmel family.  Therefore,
in order to program, you must be using <b>avr-gcc3.2 or higher</b>.  
<p>
<b>Please re-program your MotorBoards first!</b>  Many things have been
added since code was last downloaded to the motorboards.

<p>You will notice that you may need to add a sensorboard in the 
programming board stack as shown below.  In addition, a 3V power supply 
(available from Radio Shack) needs to be used while programming.  This
is taken care of when using the latest mica2 programming board.

    Setting up the Makefiles</FONT>

Because the CotsBots software is placed in the separate tinyos-1.x/contrib
directory, one small addition must be made if using a Makelocal file in your 
standard tinyos-1.x/apps directory.  You may be using this if you are
working on an IBM Thinkpad, where you need to set the extra -dlpt=3 flag.  Just
modify the Makelocal file in tinyos-1.x/contrib/cotsbots/apps/ to be the
same as that in your primary apps directory.

    Running RobotCmdGUI</FONT> 
      </B></NOBR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>

If you would like to have external control of the robot (for the TestMotorBoard
and TestNavigation applications), you will need to use the RobotCmdGUI
provided in the tinyos-1.x/contrib/cotsbots/tools directory.  Once again,
because the software is installed in the contrib directory, you will need
to modify your CLASSPATH environment variable.  Often you need to be
a computer administrator to do this.  Add the following directory to the
CLASSPATH.
<p><pre>
{INSTALL DRIVE}/tinyos-1.x/contrib/cotsbots/tools;
</pre>

And that should be it!  You are ready to play with the CotsBots!
