README for TestMotorBoard
Author/Contact: cotsbots-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

TestMotorBoard tests the interface to the motorboard.  It receives and
sends messages over the radio interface as well as over the motor board
interface.  Incoming radio packets are transformed into motor packets.  In
addition, packets sent from the motor board (which may contain accelerometer
or servo debugging information) are relayed back over the radio.

LED Debugging:
RED_LED -- toggles when a message is received from the motor board.
GREEN_LED -- toggles when a message is sent to the motor board.
YELLOW_LED -- can be toggled from a motor board command or externally to
  test communication.

Tools:

tools/java/net/tinyos/cotsbots/RobotCmdGUI provides an excelling GUI with
which to test and calibrate various properties on the motor board.

Known bugs/limitations:

As hardware drivers and new capabilities are added to the motor board, 
they should also be added to this component for testing as well as 
commands/message types in tos/lib/Robot/MotorBoard.h.  The current 
implementation of this component is by no means complete.
