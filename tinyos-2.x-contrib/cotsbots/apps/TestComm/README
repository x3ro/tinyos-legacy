README for TestComm

Description:

TestComm provides a test platform for sending and receiving motor packets.
This program runs on the mica(2) mote and sends messages to the motor
board periodically telling it to turn on its LED.  TestCommMotor does
the same thing from the motor board.  It periodically sends messages
to the mica mote to toggle its LED.

LED Debugging:
RED_LED -- toggles when a message is received 
GREEN_LED -- toggles when a message is sent
YELLOW_LED -- toggled when it receives an LED_TOGGLE command from the
	motor board
MOTOR_LED -- toggles when a message is sent or an LED_TOGGLE message
	is received

NOTE: I2C is not currently implemented on the Motor Board.  The I2C protocol
requires pull-up resistors on the I2C clock and data lines which do not
exist in our current schematic.  These may be added manually if I2C is
desired, or UART communication will suffice for most applications.  The 
resistors may exist anywhere and are not limited to the motorboard, so if
you are using another board that has these pull-up resistors, you should
be okay.

Tools:

No tools needed.

Known bugs/limitations:

This component is primarily used to calibrate the internal RC oscillator
so that I can reliably send packets over the UART.  By timing a bit
period with an oscilloscope, I can adjust the calibration constant stored
in the EEPROM accordingly (see ATmega8L documentation for more details).
