README for Figure8
Author/Contact: cotsbots-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

Figure8 runs the tos/lib/Robot/Figure8M component with the default values.
The robot should move in a figure8 pattern, although this depends 
tremendously on surface, battery voltage, etc.  Because there is no position
feedback currently being used, this pattern is completely open-loop and
must be calibrated.

Tools:

Calibration is possible through tools/java/net/tinyos/cotsbots/RobotCmdGUI 
and the TestMotorBoard application.

Known bugs/limitations:

It would be nice if the calibration values obtained above were stored in
EEPROM, but currently they are not.

Many features could be added to help close the loop (localization, a battery/
speed lookup table, etc.).
