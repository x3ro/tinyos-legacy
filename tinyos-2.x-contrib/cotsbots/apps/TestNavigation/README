README for TestNavigation
Author/Contact: cotsbots-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

TestNavigation tests the NavigationC/M component.  It accepts a radio
message that tells the robot its current x-y position in cm, its current
heading in radians (-pi,pi) and the position it should go to.  TestNavigation
calls the Navigation.navigate command to move the robot from point A to point
B.  In addition, debugging capability is provided in the Navigation component
to check the calculations at various steps.

Currently there are no debugging LEDs in this application.

Tools:
To send coordinates to the TestNavigation application, use 
tools/java/net/tinyos/cotsbots/RobotCmd

It is hoped in the future that this functionality may also be provided through
the GUI in tools/java/net/tinyos/cotsbots/RobotCmdGUI

Known bugs/limitations:

Navigation is an open-loop component in its current implementation.  The speed
needs to be set so that it corresponds to approximately 40cm/sec on whatever
surface is being used at whatever battery voltage you are currently at.

I am currently working on an automatic speed calibration component so that
you can set the robot down with a couple motes and it will calibrate itself
for speed before you use the Navigation component.
