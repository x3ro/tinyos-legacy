   * This primitive allows the next higher layer to initiate route discovery.
   * @param DstAddrMode  A parameter specifying the kind of destination address
   *                     provided. The DstAddrMode parameter may take one of
   *                     the following three values:
   *                     0x00 = No destination address
   *                     0x01 = 16-bit network address of a multicast group
   *                     0x02 = 16-bit network address of an individual device
   * @param DstAddr      The destination of the route discovery.
   *                     If the DstAddrMode parameter has a value of 0x00 then
   *                     no DstAddr will be supplied. This indicates that the
   *                     route discovery will be a many-to-one discovery with
   *                     the device issuing the discovery command as a target.
   *                     If the DstAddrMode parameter is 0x01, indicating
   *                     multicast route discovery then the destination will be
   *                     the 16-bit network address of a multicast group.
   *                     If the DstAddrMode parameter is 0x02, this indicates
   *                     unicast route discovery. The DstAddr will be the
   *                     16-bit network address of a device to be discovered.
   * @param Radius       This optional parameter describes the number of hops
   *                     that the route request will travel through the network.
   * @param NoRouteCache In the case DstAddrMode has a zero value, indicating
   *                     many-to-one route discovery, this flag determines
   *                     whether the NWK should establish a route record table.
   *                     TRUE = no route record table should be established
   *                     FALSE = establish a route record table
