  /**
   * This primitive requests the transfer of a data PDU (NSDU) from the local
   * APS sub-layer entity to a single or multiple peer APS sub-layer entities.
   * @param DstAddrMode     The type of destination address supplied by the
   *                        DstAddr parameter. One of the following two values:
   *                        0x01 = 16-bit multicast group address
   *                        0x02 = 16-bit network address of a device or a
   *                        16-bit broadcast address
   * @param DstAddr         Destination address.
   * @param NsduLength      The number of octets comprising the NSDU to be
   *                        transferred. This has been modified from the
   *                        aMaxMACFrameSize limit specified in the IEEE
   *                        802.15.4 specification to take into account that
   *                        the ZigBee network layer does not use the extended
   *                        addressing modes. The effect of this is to free the
   *                        unused portion of the header used for payload.
   * @param Nsdu            The set of octets of the NSDU to be transferred.
   * @param NsduHandle      The handle associated with the NSDU to be
   *                        transmitted by the NWK layer entity.
   * @param Radius          The distance, in hops, that a frame will be allowed
   *                        to travel through the network.
   * @param NonmemberRadius The distance, in hops, that a multicast frame will
   *                        be relayed by nodes not a member of the group. A
   *                        value of 0x07 is treated as infinity.
   * @param DiscoverRoute   This parameter may be used to control route
   *                        discovery operations for the transit of this frame:
   *                        0x00 = suppress route discovery
   *                        0x01 = enable route discovery
   * @param SecurityEnable  This parameter may be used to enable NWK layer
   *                        security processing for the current frame. If the
   *                        nwkSecurityLevel attribute of the NIB is 0, meaning
   *                        no security, then this parameter will be ignored.
   *                        Otherwise, a value of TRUE denotes that the
   *                        security processing specified by the security level
   *                        will be applied, and a value of FALSE denotes that
   *                        no security processing will be applied.
