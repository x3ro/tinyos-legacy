/**
 * An interface describing a pool for messages.
 *
 * Message pools are very tricky in TinyOS. Internally, TinyOS
 * maintains some message buffers, for instance, for receiving
 * content through the radio. To avoid message copying, TinyOS
 * provides the possibility to dynamically substitute these buffers.
 * Therefore, it may happen that a message buffer from outside the
 * pool is freed, such that it lands in the pool. Later, such a buffer
 * can be returned as a result of some allocation request.
 *
 * For these reasons, we do not check correctness of the free and alloc
 * requests. More specifically, we do not check whether the freed or
 * allocated buffer actually belongs to the pool, or even whether it
 * is a message buffer in the first place.
