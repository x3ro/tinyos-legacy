README for HIERCLUST
Author: Konrad Iwanicki <iwanicki@few.vu.nl>

Description:

These are fragments of a hierarchical point-to-point routing framework
for TinyOS 2.0.0. The evaluation of the framework was first published in
K. Iwanicki and M. van Steen, ``On Hierarchical Routing in Wireless Sensor
Networks,'' in IPSN'09: Proceedings of the Eighth ACM/IEEE Int'l Conf. on
Information Processing in Sensor Networks, IP Track, San Francisco, CA,
USA, April 2009.
  The directory contains source code of the three different cluster
hierarchy maintenance techniques presented in the paper. Moreover, it
includes the hierarchical forwarding algorithm.

Tools:

Known bugs/limitations:

The author has put a lot of effort to extract the code for which he has
got an OK to publish from the full original framework and to compose it
into a working whole. The code in this directory is the result of that
process. Although it was briefly tested that the code works, the extraction
process could introduce some artifacts. Sorry for that...
