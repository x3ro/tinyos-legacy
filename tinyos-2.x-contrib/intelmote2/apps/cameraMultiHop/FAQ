no, this is for transmitting a single image at a time. JpegSerial app sends
images over the serial port, which is much faster (about a second for jpeg imgs).
MultiHop app sends images over the radio, using CTP. we have no documentation...

images are 320x240, but the imager chip is capable of taking 640x480 images. you
do need to get jpeg-6b open source jpeg implementation to be able to compile our
c application (get_jpg.c) that converts mote data to jpg file. you can find more
info in README file.
