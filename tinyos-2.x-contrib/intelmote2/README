TinyOS CVS repository of intelmote2 contrib code.

What is Required:
=================
- download this contrib directory to /opt/
- set environment variable INTELMOTE2_CONTRIB_DIR as follows
  export INTELMOTE2_CONTRIB_DIR=/opt/tinyos-2.x-contrib/intelmote2

Suggestions:
============
To make sure that your application includes all source files properly, we
suggest to compile applications from $INTELMOTE2_CONTRIB_DIR/apps directory.
This is because we set a number of extra compilation parameters in
$INTELMOTE2_CONTRIB_DIR/suport/make/intelmote2.extra and modify
$INTELMOTE2_CONTRIB_DIR/apps/Makerules to automatically include required files.
(see the modified Makefile in $INTELMOTE2_CONTRIB_DIR/apps/Blink)
