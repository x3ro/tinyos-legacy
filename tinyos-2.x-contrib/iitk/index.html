<h1>Simulation of MAC protocols of Wireless Sensor Networks</h1>

<p>
In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), sensor nodes are often inaccessible for battery
replacement. To increase the network lifetime, energy consumption by sensor nodes should be
minimum. Recent researches have presented many Medim Access Control (MAC) protocols with
an aim to minimize energy consumption. However, the MAC protocols behave differently under
different network scenarios.
In this project, we aim to evaluate MAC protocols based on energy consumption, by simulating
them under same simulation scenarios and platform. Implementation of MAC protocols is done
in TOSSIM, a simulator for WSN applications, which directly simulates code to be run on real
hardware, thus reducing the gap between simulation and real hardware. Current implementation
includes CSMA/CA, Sensor-MAC, Timeout-MAC, Berkley-MAC and Berkley+ MAC
protocols. Each MAC protocols is then integrated with PowerTOSSIM-Z, a power modelling
tool, to measure the energy consumption.
Implementation of MAC protocols is done as low level components and high level abstraction is
provided to enable users to switch between different MAC protocols. During simulating their
WSN applicaions, users can switch between different MAC protocols and evaluate that which
MAC protocols is best suited to their specific application.
