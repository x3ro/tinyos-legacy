OVERVIEW:

The SimX/TxPower module provides a way for motes to simulate changing
transmission power. It must be wired up in the TOSSIM simulation
environment to a topology manager.

WARNING:

Unlike with the standard TinyOS 2.x CC2420Packet interface which
allows setting the power per packet, changing the power in
SimX/TxPower forces the network topology and link-gain information to
be recomputed for the effected nodes. As such, setting and retrieving
the TxPower is a GLOBAL operation: care must be taken in the TinyOS
code to ensure that the correct power level is really used during the
actual transmission of a particular message. One method is to use a
radio queue/proxy.
