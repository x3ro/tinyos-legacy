	Sampling of the sensor. The unit is the milliseconds.
	
	MINIMUM_SAMPLING_PERIOD is the minimum value that should
	be broadcasted to the network to avoid congestion issues.
	A formula that can be used is, with N the number of motes 
	of the network, and MINIMUM_SAMPLING_PERIOD in ms :
	MINIMUM_SAMPLING_PERIOD = 100 * N
	
	Threshold of the sensor. A threshold of 0 means that
	the value is sent every time. Else the threshold is
	a 16-bits unsigned integer.

	The user can define the sleep duty cycle and the awake
	duty cycle in units of [percent * 100]. For example, to
	get a 0.05% duty cycle, use the value 5, and for a 100%
	duty cycle (always on), use the value 10000. 
	This is the equivalent of setting the local sleep 
	interval explicitly.
