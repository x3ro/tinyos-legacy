This directory was original retrieved from the TinyOS 2.x contrib CVS
on 10 Oct 2008. The application has been modified to work under Tossim
and use Simx components. Original files have been renamed *.orig*, as
appropriate.


Building Octopus for Tossim/Simx:

SIMXLIB=/path/to/simx/lib make micaz sim

Replace "sim" with "sim-sf" to enable Serial-Forward. If the
environment variable SIMXLIB is pre-configured and exported it does
not need to appear before the "make" command.


Summary of Changes:

"#idndef TOSSIM" clauses in OctopusAppC.nc and OctopusC.nc to disable
CC2420ActiveMessageC usage and, by extension, LPL. Tossim, only
provides the ActiveMessageC and SerialActiveMessageC components.

Changed Sensor wiring in OctopusAppC.nc to use "new SimxSensor(0,
uint16_t)".

Makefile adjusted to setup required include paths and include
"Makefile.tos" sources for Simx components.
