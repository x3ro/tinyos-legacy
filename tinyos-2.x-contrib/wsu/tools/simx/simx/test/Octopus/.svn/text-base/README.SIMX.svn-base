This directory (and subdirectories) was fetched from the TinyOS 2.x
CVS on 10-Oct-2008. This checkout has been modified to work with
Tossim and demonstrate various SimX components.

LPL is not supported in Tossim and has been disabled. Additionally,
some problems with the checkout have fixed; the extension *.orig* has
been appended as appropriate.

See motes/README.SIMX for specific changes to enable building under
Tossim/Simx.
