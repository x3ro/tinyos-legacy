DynTopo

DynTopo is a dynamic Topology manager for TOSSIM/T2 that allows not
only dynamic topologies, but also includes a TOSSIM/T2 nesC interface
to set the transmit power.

DynTopo essentially incorporates a modified version of the
LinkLayerModel generator from USC in a Python interface with TinyOS
bridge.

Because there is random variance in creating the models, and the
models themselves may be modified over time, DynTopo should not be
used as the source of running repeatable tests. For information
setting up a realistic simulation environment, look at the TOSSIM Live
thesis by Chad Metcalf.
