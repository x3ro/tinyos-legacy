TReact is a Python interface to allow interactive (reactive) control
with a TOSSIM/T2 environment.

It works by processing messages (using SFInject) and reacting
accordingly. The primary incoming message simply requests that a
particular bit of python is executed. Outbound messages (generally
containing "data") are more structured and include Node positions,
transmission powers, and more detailed data about the simulation
environment.
