This python library directory was taken from the simplejson 2.0.3
project -- it IS NOT THE FULL simplejson package.  simplejson is
distributed under the MIT license. See LICENSE.txt.

_speedups.c has been removed; this is intended only as a fall-back
JSON implementation. Ideally, simplejson has already installed
correctly for the target platform.

Python files have been modified to use relative imports.
