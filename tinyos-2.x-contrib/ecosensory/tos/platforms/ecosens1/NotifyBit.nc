 * The Notify interface is intended for delivery of values from
 * self-triggered devices, at relatively low rates. For example, a
 * driver for a motion detector or a switch might provide this
 * interface. The type of the value is given as a template
 * argument. Generally, these values are backed by memory or
 * computation. Because no error code is included, both calls must be
 * guaranteed to succeed. This interface should be used when a single
 * logical unit supports both getting and setting.
 *
 * See TEP114 - SIDs: Source and Sink Independent Drivers for details.
