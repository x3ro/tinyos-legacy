SwitchC() uses a get() to read in a 1 or 0, then defines
 interrupt to trigger on rising or falling; whatever is next.
  Each trigger, it does a send event
 that includes signal Notify.notify( pinHigh )
the value of type <bool>0 or 1 pin state.

Every down of the switch display one LED, and change to the
 next IO test that outputs 1Hz square 0 and 1 values on 
a port pin.
