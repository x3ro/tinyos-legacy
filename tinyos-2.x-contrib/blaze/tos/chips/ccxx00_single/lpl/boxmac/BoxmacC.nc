/**
 * Reference this file in the application layer and you can acheive
 * shorter wake-up transmissions for a given receive check interval.
 * This library makes your BMAC implementation more efficient by turning it 
 * into BoX-MAC (short energy based BMAC receive checks + semi-packetized
 * wake-up transmissions).
 *
 * The original wake-up transmission is divided by WAKEUP_TRANSMISSION_DIVISIONS
 * defined in the Boxmac.h header file.  The PacketLink layer is
 * accessed to perform automatic retries of the packet, and the CSMA layer
 * is tapped to remove clear channel assessments on subsequent retries.
 *
 * Your application layer must supply the SendNotifier interface which allows 
 * this library to function. The reason you supply the interface is so your
 * system can setup an initial default packet configuration before letting
 * the boxmac hybrid work its energy saving magic.
 *
 * Your packet delivery success rate will decrease slightly because of the
 * gaps introduced in the modulation of the wake-up transmission.
