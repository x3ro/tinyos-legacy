/**
 * We create a new State machine for the SFD interrupt line (defined in
 * the blaze stack as GDO2) so we can share it between Receive and Transmit.
 * Those two branches should be able to be compiled without dependency on
 * each other, so they refer to this component to pull in the state machine.
 * That way, one can be compiled without the other and unit testing becomes
 * more modular
