if you want to use this patch to build apps
on the SoftBaugh MRF1611CC1100, you'll need
to do a few things:
  - remove ***ALL*** of the jumpers from the
    HMRF1611 host board (if you're using one)

  - check out tinyos-2.x-contrib from CVS

  - do something like what's in ./rc to set
    $BLAZE to point to the blaze radio stack
    in your contrib directory

  - get your SoftBaugh USBP programmer and
    installation app set up (you'll install
    build/mrf1611cc1100/main.ihex)

at this point, you should be able to build
and install at least Blink and RadioCountToLeds,
the two most important apps in existence :-)

if you want to use the jumpers on the host board,
get the MRF1611CC1100 and HMRF1611 schematics,
the 'F1611 data sheet, and hammer on MotePlatformC.
you need to make sure the MCU isn't going to melt.
by default, this patch configures them all as
output-low (per TI's recommendations about what to
do with unconnected pins).

note that this patch doesn't support any of the
hardware on the host board (buttons, pot, etc).
