Not sure why it fails, but it seems that the radio doesn't ever turn off.

I don't think that's really a problem, because the test was
originally created to make sure the platform isn't locking up.
It's definitely not locking up, but the test isn't able to 
actually turn the radio off from what I observe.  That causes
it to timeout.

Might want to @skip this one.
