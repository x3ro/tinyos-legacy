<h2> PowerNet </h2>
<p> The <a href="http://powernet.stanford.edu">PowerNet Project</a>
studies the energy consumption of computing systems. It does so by
using a large wireless mesh network of power meters, or powernet
motes. </p>

<p>
We have contributed the PowerNet mote TinyOS drivers, found in
/sensorboards, as well as a sample application, found in
/apps/PowerNetBase and /apps/powernet-ctp-instrumented. Each directory
has a README file. </p>

<h2>S4 routing Protocol</h2> <p> S4 is a point-to-point routing
protocol which significantly improves upon BVR in terms of both
routing performance and the amount of state required at each node. It
was originally written for TinyOS 1.x by Y.Mao, F. Wang et al and
published in NSDI 2007. This is a TinyOS 2.x port of the original S4
source code. The <A
HREF="s4-tinyos-2.x/apps/TestS4Simple/README">README</A> has further
details.  </p>



<h2> Grant-to-Send </h2>

<p>Grant-to-send(GTS) is a collision avoidance mechanism with no
control packets which can be used for protocol isolation mechanism. By
using GTS, each protocol can prevent not only intra-protocol
collisions but also inter-protocol collisions.  With this collision
avoidance, each protocol can improve performance and also debugging
becomes easier due to less interactions between protocols.  </p>

<p> Grant-to-send adds grant duration field (one byte) to each packet.
Transmitter and overhearer of this packet are suppressed during this
grant, and receiver becomes the only sender around the previous
transmitter.  </p>

<p> The grant duration must be set to be the time by which the
receiver finishes its transmissions. For simple forwarding (as in
collection protocols) the grant should be one packet time (~10ms
depending on the length of the packet). When GTS is used for Deluge,
request packets can set its grant duration to be the duration of data
burst they are requesting (number of pkts * one packet time).  When
the grant duration is zero, it reverts to regular CSMA network.  </p>

<p> For inter-operability, CC2420 packet header has one more field,
GTS-packet indication field (one byte). CC2420ReceiveP for GTS checks
for this field and filters out non-GTS packets.  </p>

<h2> Fair Waiting Protocol </h2>

<p> The key insight behind <a
href="http://sing.stanford.edu/mnet/mnet.html">the MNet
architecture</a> is that isolation improves visibility. Just as the
isolation between processes in an OS makes it easier to determine what
causes a crash, isolating protocols can simplify network
troubleshooting. To achieve this goal, the MNet architecture
institutes the Fair Waiting Protocol (FWP) between wireless sensor
protocols and single-hop packet communication. Reversing the common
approach of requesting the channel, FWP allows a protocol to grant its
local channel to another node to prevent local collisions. FWP
provides a sound basis for building higher -level protocols.  </p>

<p> FWP introduces two mechanisms to isolate protocols from one
another. The first is grant-to-send, a novel collision avoidance
scheme where protocols provide information on future transmissions in
each data packet. As the name suggests, rather than request a node's
channel by sending it a control packet, as request-to-send
/clear-to-send protocols do, in grant-to-send a node can give its
channel to another node by transmitting to it. Grant-to-send
introduces a single byte header to each data packet, a much smaller
overhead than the two packet handshake of
request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) protocols, but our initial
experiments suggest it can isolate protocols well and greatly avoid
collisions. Furthermore, grant-to-send can be used for broadcast based
protocols, while RTS/CTS is unusable because it must request the
channel from every destination. Instead, with grant-to-send, a node
can request a broadcast by granting its channel. 
     
</p>

<p> FWP's second mechanism is fair queuing. Just as an operating
system schedules processes to share the processor, FWP schedules
protocols to share the wireless channel, using a classical fair
queuing algorithm. Protocol grant times provide a clear measurement of
channel occupancy. Fair queuing in a multi-hop wireless network is a
challenging problem, as each node has its own individual view of
channel usage. There are traffic patterns which cannot be scheduled
fairly at all nodes. Furthermore, as not all nodes have the same
workload, they must implicitly schedule protocols fairly based on
limited information. We are exploring one approach FWP can use to
achieve this goal, called protocol penalties.  </p>

<h2>RssiSample</h2>
<p>The RssiSample application samples the RSSI register of the CC2420
radio on the telosb platform at a fixed rate. At compile-time, you can
configure the rate as well as the number of samples to collect. When
the node boots, it begins sampling, storing the readings to flash.
When it collects all of the samples, it sends them the the UART. There
is a Java application to read the UART messages and print the results.

details.</p>
