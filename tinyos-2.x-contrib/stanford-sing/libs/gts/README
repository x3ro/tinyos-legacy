Grant-to-Send README 06/18/2008

== General Notes
 * Compatible with TinyOS 2.0.1 CC2420 and TOSSIM

== Usage instruction
 1. In Makefile, include the following line:
    CFLAGS += -D(gts directory) -DCC2420_NO_ADDRESS_RECOGNITION
 
 2. Use GTSAMSenderC component and GTSAMSend interface instead of AMSenderC and
    AMSend in your application. send() in GTSAMSend interface has one more 
    argument, grant duration(in ms).
    
 ** When used for TOSSIM, follow the above instructions except 
    CC2420_NO_ADDRESS_RECOGNITION. 

== Grant-to-send description

Grant-to-send(GTS) is a collision avoidance mechanism with no control packets
which can be used for protocol isolation mechanism. By using GTS, each protocol
can prevent not only intra-protocol collisions but also inter-protocol collisions.
With this collision avoidance, each protocol can improve performance and also 
debugging becomes easier due to less interactions between protocols.

Grant-to-send adds grant duration field (one byte) to each packet. Transmitter
and overhearer of this packet are suppressed during this grant, and receiver
becomes the only sender around the previous transmitter. 

The grant duration must be set to be the time by which the receiver finishes
its transmissions. For simple forwarding (as in collection protocols) the grant
should be one packet time (~10ms depending on the length of the packet). When
GTS is used for Deluge, request packets can set its grant duration to be the
duration of data burst they are requesting (number of pkts * one packet time). 
When the grant duration is zero, it reverts to regular CSMA network.

For inter-operability, CC2420 packet header has one more field, GTS-packet
indication field (one byte). CC2420ReceiveP for GTS checks for this field
and filters out non-GTS packets.
