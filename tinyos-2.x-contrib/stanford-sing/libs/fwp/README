Makefile : Include the following(s)
-I<Dir with FWP files>
-DNO_PROTOCOL_PENALTY : Achieves more throughput with less fairness (optional)

Usage :

FWP currently supports CC2420 Radio without LPL only.

Use FairAMSend and FairAMSenderC instead of AMSend and AMSenderC. 
FairAMSend interface has one more argument, the quiet time. The sending 
and overhearing node of the packet should be quiet for the specified 
amount of the time. 

Quiet time is one byte, appended to the CC2420 header. Thus the maximum 
is 255ms. However, it can be scaled with PACKET_TIME defined at FairAMQueueImplP.nc. 

Quiet time is generally the time the recipient of the packet will respond by. 
For instance, if the recipient is forwarding the packet, the quiet time would 
be one packet time, approx. 8ms for CC2420 Radio. If the recipient is 
responding with bursts of packet, e.g. Deluge's request packet, the quiet 
time should be (# of packets) * (Packet Time). If the recipient is not anticipated 
to transmit, the quiet time should be zero.
