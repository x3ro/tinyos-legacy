This is a sample application for the PowerNet motes that measure
real-time power draw. The code samplies the ADE chip once per second
to get instantaneous power draw. Power Readings are buffered and when
the buffer is full it is sent to the base station. 

The code uses the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) to get data to the
basestation. Here we used a modified version of CTP, hence the shadow
ctp/ directory. The modifications allow us to collect data about the
state of the network: ETX, etc.

The code also includes Deluge so that meters can be reprogrammed
remotely.

To view the data, use a packet sniffer, or an additional mote running
the PowerBase application, and issuing  the following command:
> java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB*:telosb

The radio operates on channel 26, and the setting can be changes in the
Makefile. Make sure both base station and motes are on the same
channel.

To program onto the powernet board using the miniprogrammer, run
> make epic install miniprog

The drivers for SPI communication with the ADE7753 are located under
sensorboards/PowerNetDriver
