Description:
FireSim is a fire simulator for Tossim. It uses the API fireLib. 
The simulator FireSim just uses the results that fireLib returns 
and passes it to tossim. 

(fireLib is a C function library for predicting wildland fire behavior
using the BEHAVE algorithms. fireLib is for programmers who need a 
highly optimized application programming interface for developing 
fire behavior growth simulators.)
