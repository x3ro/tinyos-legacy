<h1>TinyOS Contribution from Aarhus University</h1>

Below you will find a list of maintained projects from Aarhus University.
For any questions or comments please contact: mth at cs dot au dot dk.

<h2> Unified Broadcast </h2>

Code for unifying broadcast in TinyOS.  For further details see paper titled Unified Broadcast in Sensor Networks from IPSN 2011.

<h2> Misc </h2>

<p>
This project contains miscellaneous libraries that can be used in different projects
</p>

<h3>Generic Neighbor Table</h3>
<i> misc/tos/lib/neighbortable </i>

<p>
A generic neighbor table that can be extended by creating new components.  See an example of how to extend it in neighbortable/example.
</p>


<h3>Time Measures</h3>
<i> misc/tos/lib/timemeasures </i>

<p>
A library for supporting various time measures in TinyOS.  This can be
used in protocol or implementation evaluations.
</p>

<p>
Quick empirical time measured can be done by using the Quicktime
components which can be controlled by calls to time_start(),
time_stop(), and time_get().
</p>

<h3>Random Back-off Timer</h3>
<i> misc/tos/lib/timer </i>

<p>
A TimerTMilliC with a random back-off.  The timer keeps its period, but
always fires with [period/2, period].  This can be used to avoid
timers on different motes firing at the same time.
