***** tos/lib/tossim/sim *****

Implements CC2420 functionality for TOSSIM.  Supported features include:

- Ieee154MessageC
- Packet link layer functionality.
- Duplicate detection.
- Low power listening

The only changed files compared to the original tinyos TOSSIM tree is:

		MainC: removed the line that always includes TossimActiveMessageC			
		ActiveMessageC: added the CC2420 send and receive layers
		TossimRadioMsg.h: added packet link and lpl metadata
		TossimPacketModelC: added the ChannelAccess interface to to check the channel for activity.
		PowerCycleP: Changed the CCA checks to use a timer instead of synchronous checks which does not work with TOSSIM

The number of CCA checks in PowerCycleP is measured based on simple time tests.  The length if the entire CCA check needs to be longer than the space between packet.

Add the following to your Makefile in order to compile.
