/**Bluetooth interface.

   <p>Provides an interface to a number of common Bluetooth commands 
   and required events.</p>

   <p>The overall sematic is that commands (and associated data) are
   "posted", which means that the module takes over the data and feeds
   it to the Bluetooth module. At a later time, the interface user
   will get a postComplete event to be able to regain ownership of the
   data, and any other events that the command may give rise to.</p>

   <p>The order of the events are like this: First the command is
   posted. Sometime after this, a postComplete event will be issued
   (unless posting the command FAILs), and sometimes after this, any
   result from the command will be signalled through an event.</p>

   <p>Packets that are used for commands (ie not received in events)
   must be wellformed, and in general occupy the trailing part of the
   data area (to make room for headers).</p>

   <p>All commands that return error_t have in common that if a FAIL
   is returned no corresponding postComplete event is generated - this
   is important if some form of memory management is done: upon FAIL
   the packet must be freed somewhere else than the event handler of
   postComplete. For all operations returning FAIL, a packet supplied
   as parameter will appear unchanged, expect for postInqDefault and
   init. </p>
