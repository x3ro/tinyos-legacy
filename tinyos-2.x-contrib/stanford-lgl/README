TinyOS CVS repository of the Stanford/LGL (Leo Guibas Lab).

To run our tinyos applications properly, we suggest to check out our whole CVS 
contrib directory and compile them in place. This is because we set a number of 
extra compilation params in suport/make/lgl.extra and modify apps/Makerules to
automatically include our specific tos/* directories. 


!!! IMPORTANT !!!! 

LGL_CONTRIB env variable pointing to our stanford-lgl dir is *required*. In most
cases, type at the bash shell:
    export LGL_CONTRIB=/opt/tinyos-2.x-contrib/stanford-lgl
