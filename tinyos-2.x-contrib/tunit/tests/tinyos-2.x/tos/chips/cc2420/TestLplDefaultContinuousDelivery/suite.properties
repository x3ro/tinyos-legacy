@description Each node continuously sends unicasts.  The receiver (0) collects.
    As each transmitter sends, the receiver keeps track of how many transmitters
    there are out there.  Then we average up the number of received messages
    across all transmitters after a minute.  We should theoretically see the
    channel being shared fairly.  The test fails if any transmitter gets more
    or less than 10% of the average packets through.  Also, we analyze whether
    or not our detection strategy is effective.  Each attempt should result in
    a detect for the most part.
