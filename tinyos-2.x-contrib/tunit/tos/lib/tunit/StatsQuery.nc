 * then this event goes to it through its own wiring. If it's not
 * there, then this event returns a default value inside the 
 * component where it is provided (TUnitP).  The test run framework
 * cannot continue onto the next test or signal allDone until it
 * knows that the Statistics component has finished up whatever it's
