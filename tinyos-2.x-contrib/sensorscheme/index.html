<h1>The sensorscheme project</h1>

SensorScheme is an embedded interpreter for tinyos applications based on the
programming language Scheme. The library contains all the necessary tools to 
build SensorScheme-enabled applications, and to build and run programs inside 
the interpreter. SensorScheme's main benefits lie in lightweight over-the-air 
reprogramming and rapid application development.

The SensorScheme language supports a large subset of the scheme language, with 
some minor adaptations for WSNs. It features tailcall elimination continuations 
and contains purpose-built memory management for WSN platforms to ensure high 
performance and maximum memory use.


To install and use SensorScheme, read the readme file in the sensorscheme root folder.
