<h1>Device Driver of MDA300ca</h1>
<p>The presented source code is the device driver of MDA300ca, which is a sensor board pluggable to any wireless modules including Iris. The device driver is designed according to the HIL/HAL/HPL schema advocated by TinyOS. Power management is integreated in
 the driver. This means that AD warm-up and cool-down are automatically accomplished when the commands from the interface is invoked. Usage and installation are describbed in the readme file.
</p>
<p>The source code is contributed by the Distributed and Mobile Systems Lab (DAMSEL) in University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). Any comments and questions are welcomed and can be emailed to: Ramiro.Liscano@uoit.ca
