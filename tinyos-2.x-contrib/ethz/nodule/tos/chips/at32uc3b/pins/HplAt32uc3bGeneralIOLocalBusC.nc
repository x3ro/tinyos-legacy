/**
 * HPL for the Atmel AT32UC3B microcontroller. This provides an
 * abstraction for general-purpose I/O.
 *
 * Mapping registers on the local bus allows cycle-deterministic
 * toggling of GPIO  pins since the CPU and GPIO are the only
 * modules connected to this bus. Also, since the local bus runs
 * at CPU speed, one write or read operation can be performed
 * per clock cycle to the local busmapped GPIO registers.
