Please note:

The synchronization messages are sent by unicast, i.e. from one node (suppose node i) to another specified node (node i+1).

1. The DsnSend interface helps to print out some debugging information generated by the TimeSync component. In order to make the DSN component work, you might need to include a path in the Makefile: e.g.  PFLAGS += -I../tos/lib/dsn -DUSART=1
Or you can comment out the DSN component and DsnSend interface, the synchronization components will then compile

2. The synchronization rate (time interval of synchronization messages) can be set as  PFLAGS += -DTIMESYNC_RATE=t
where t is the number of seconds, e.g. 100, 200, etc

3. Suppose you have n nodes, please specify their IDs as 0, 1, ... n when you install an application

4. If a mote toggles the red LED, it is considered to be synchronized. The blinking of the blue LED means the mote has received a valid synchronization message.
