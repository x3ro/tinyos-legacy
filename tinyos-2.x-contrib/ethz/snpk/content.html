<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Many projects within <a href="http://www.mics.org" target="_blank">MICS</a> are sharing similar requirements in respect to hard- and software platforms. 
In order to accelerate the initial startup on hands-on experimentation and to facilitate the sharing of resources and know-how within MICS 
we propose a common base infrastructure that will be made available to MICS partners and supported by MICS staff.
</p>

<p>
The Sensor Network Platform Kit (SNPK) is made up of components that are considered to be the state-of-the-art and known-to-work. 
The unique approach combines both technology from industry as well as know-how and reliable prototypes from researchers to form a baseline opensource solution. 
The SNPK offers a service to researchers containing a shopping list for hardware components, downloadable software, 
technical support for affiliated members as well as an open community base for discussion and exchange

<h3>Low power CC2420 radio stack (for Tmote Sky)</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
This radio stack adds a per hop synchronization to the existing CC2420 low power listening radio stack.
The main changes are:
<ul>
<li>make cca sampling time (radio wakeup) predictable, e.g. wake up with a fixed period</li>
<li>add the ability to send packets exactly at a given time (32khz jiffy granularity)</li>
<li>add time information to each packet sent, in order to share wakeuptimes and clock skews with neighbour nodes</li>
</ul>
This radio stack behaves as follows: As long as there is no time information about target nodes available, packets are sent with a &quot;long preamble&quot;, e.g. as a
packet burst (see original T2 CC2420 radio stack for documentation). As time goes by, received packets add time information about the neighbourhood of a node. For every neighbour,
a time measurement history is saved. Packets for those neighbours are then exactly scheduled at its wakeup time (plus/minus some backoff). The bigger the History gets, the more accurately
the drift to every neighbour can be calculated.
<br>With time information, packets can be sent with almost no extra energy wasted. There is a poster abstract available <a href="#harvester_poster">[1]</a> that describes this mechanism e bit more in detail and also provides a performance comparison to the default LPL stack.
<br>
<br><br>
The following picture shows a typical current curve, measured on a TmoteSky. The second peak is caused by a transmission, where the others are channel samplings between sleep phases:

<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>
The simplest way to add this energy saving radio stack to your application, is by adding following lines to your Makefile (example can be found in the ./app/MultihopOscilloscope directory):
<div style="border:1px solid;padding:0.3em;background:#ffffa0">
<pre>CFLAGS += -DLOW_POWER_LISTENING -DLPL_DEFAULT_SLEEP_INTERVAL=250
CC2420DIR=../../tos/chips/cc2420
CFLAGS += -I$(CC2420DIR) -I$(CC2420DIR)/alarm -I$(CC2420DIR)/control -I$(CC2420DIR)/csma -I$(CC2420DIR)/interfaces -I$(CC2420DIR)/link
CFLAGS += -I$(CC2420DIR)/lowpan -I$(CC2420DIR)/lpl -I$(CC2420DIR)/packet -I$(CC2420DIR)/receive -I$(CC2420DIR)/spi -I$(CC2420DIR)/transmit
CFLAGS += -I$(CC2420DIR)/unique -I$(CC2420DIR)/sync
CFLAGS += -DENABLE_SPI0_DMA</pre>
</div> 
<ul>
<li><b>LPL_DEFAULT_SLEEP_INTERVAL</b>: This variable selects the radio sleep interval in milliseconds. Values from 100 to 16000 are possible.</li>
<li><b>CC2420DIR</b>: This is the path to the tos/chips/cc2420 directory in this contrib folder</li>
</ul>
With this small modification, it should be possible to run all standard Tinyos 2.x applications.
</p>
<p>when <b>LPL_DEFAULT_SLEEP_INTERVAL</b> is not set, the parameters of the radio stack can be set with the <i>LowPowerListening</i> interface. This radio stack offers the ability, to save power by sending subsequent packets to a neighbour, after the first packets was successfully transmitted. For this purpose
it is necessary to set the &quot;more&quot;-flag in the first packet, in order to keep the receiver node awake for some longer time. This flag can be set or cleared with the <i>NeighbourSyncFlowPacket</i> interface. This interface provides following function:
<div style="border:1px solid;padding:0.3em;background:#ffffa0"">
<pre>interface NeighbourSyncFlowPacket {
	command	void setMore(message_t* msg);
	command	void clearMore(message_t* msg);
}</pre>
</div>
</p>
<h4>Performance in a TinyOS2.x standard application: MultihopOscilloscope</h4>
In order to get a rough comparison between the default CC2420 lpl radio stack and our partly synchronized radio stack, we traced the current for a node, running the
MultihopOscilloscop application. Following parameters were used:
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><b>Parameter</b></td><td><b>Value</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Sleep duration</td><td>250 ms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Data generation rate</td><td>1 sample per 10 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Packet generation rate</td><td>1 packet per 40 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>TX Power</td><td>20</td></tr>
</table>
Not counting the current drawn by the LED, we measured a mean current of 4.60 mA for the standard CC2420 stack, and 0.97 mA for
our modified CC2420 stack.
