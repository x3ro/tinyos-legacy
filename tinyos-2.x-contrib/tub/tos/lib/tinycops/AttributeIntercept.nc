/** 
 * This interface is used and provided by Attribute Service Extension
 * Components (ASECs). An ASEC can intercept requests for attribute data from
 * the application to the Attribute Collector. When an ASEC is present, an
 * application's request for data (via the AttributeCollection interface) is
 * forwarded to the ASEC before the actual attribute component is queried - if
 * there are multiple ASECs they must be arranged in a chain. If an ASEC can
 * serve the request for attribute data, it may return SUCCESS on the
 * getAttribute() call; then it MUST also signal a getAttributeDone() event. If
 * it cannot serve a request, it MUST forward the getAttribute() call to the
 * next ASEC in the chain, where the AttributeCollectorP is always the last
 * element in the chain. On the reverse path, every ASEC MUST forward the
 * getAttributeDone() event which is initially signalled by
 * AttributeCollectorP, but it may modify the content of attribute value,
 * depending on the metadata in the corresponding subscription.
