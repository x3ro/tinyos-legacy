 * The TinyCOPSClientC provides structured access to TinyCOPS, i.e.
 * every Publisher/Subscriber component should instantiate its own
 * TinyCOPSClientC and use only its provided interfaces. At the same time
 * the Publisher/Subscriber component has to wire the used interfaces
 * to its desired notification and subscription delivery protocol.
