Usage for Mica2 radio Simulation

Description:

  TestAM application is used to test the CC1000 radio simulation.  
The application has been modified to include the unicast packet transmission
and also to include extra 2 bytes in transmission, the count and the TOS_NODE_ID.
Just change AM_BROADCAST_ADDR to nodeid to have a unicast transmission.
If TOS_NODE_ID is 1, it sends a unicast packet to 0 
If TOS_NODE_ID is 0, it sends a unicast packet to 1.  

For rest, its just Broadcast address.

Tools:

test.py :
  This python script is used to run the simulation.  There are different 
debug channels as mentioned below to know know the status of the CC1000 simulation.

topo.txt :
  The topology file which has 5 nodes for the simulation. 
  0 <-> 1
  0 <-> 4
  
  1 <-> 2
  1 <-> 4
  
  2 <-> 3
  2 <-> 4
  
  3 <-> 4

Debug Channels:

TestAM:  This is application debug channel.

HplCC1000P: Displays the radio internal register writes and reads 

HplCC1000SpiP: Displays the radio transmission and event scheduling

CC1000SendReceiveP: Displays the transmitted and received packets along with ack.

HplAtm128AdcP:  Displays the ADC sampled value from the generated RSSI(dBm)

CC1000CsmaP:  Radio status, On or OFF, whether there is congestion or not

CC1000Channel:  Displays the channel status, channel acquired and released by a node

output:

Node_ID 	Packets Sent	Packets Received	Packets Received
							 (with UNICAST)		(with only BROADCAST addr)
	0			10					19 				19		
	1			10					29				28
	2			10					20				29
	3			10					20				18
	4			10					20				39

The variations of 1 or 2 packets less is due to the fact that the simulation ends
while there is still a packet to be transmitted by other nodes (due to the shift 
of the boot time of the nodes).
