OVERVIEW:
This application is used to test the context switching proceedure.
The application posts a verylow priority task, which in turn is preempted by a millisecond timer.
The TimerMilliC uses tasks to signal timer event occurs (in this way event dont have to be async).

However a long task will delay timer events. This application demonstrates the ability of basic tasks like 
the task in TimerMilliC to preempt long processing tasks.

Each task must process a task that tasks about half a second. A led is turned on 
before executing and off after. 

USAGE:
to compile you must add the priority extra target
eg
make telosb priority
