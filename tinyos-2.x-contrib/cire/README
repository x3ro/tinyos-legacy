Motenet provides a socket interface for TinyOS base station programs.

See support/sdk/c/{motenet,libnet/README for more details.

This is the tinyos-2.x-contrib version which is essentially the same as what is
branched off the svn trunk.   The directory structure mirrors the svn trunk,
support/sdk/c/{motenet,libnet,sf}.

The main components are:

motenet: The core of libmotenet.  Libmotenet provides the socket interface for
both AM and IPv6 sockets.  It is a superset of the libmote library previously
provided for base station communications.  Libmotenet current uses the serial
forwarder (support/sdk/c/sf) for gateway functions.

libnet: provides various misc. network functions used by libmotenet.  See
libnet/README for details.

sf: a copy of the serial forwarder provided by the svn trunk.   Here to enable
independent compilation.  No changes from the svn trunk.

support/sdk/java/net/tinyos/packet/BaudRate.java: used by sf.  Same as
what is in the svn trunk.
