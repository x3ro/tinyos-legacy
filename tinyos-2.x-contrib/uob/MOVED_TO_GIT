Due to the limitations of CVS and slow response of
tinyos-2.x-caretakers to add people to uob project, we have decided to
move the repository to git.

Hopefully TinyOS 2.x is moving to git anyway, let's see when this happens.

The new location to find applications of University of Bremen ComNets is:
http://www.comnets.uni-bremen.de/gitweb/

Get a copy with:
git clone http://www.comnets.uni-bremen.de/~mab/git/tinyos-2.x.git
and/or
git clone http://www.comnets.uni-bremen.de/~mab/git/tinyos-2.x-contrib.git
