Note: although this dir is called hcs08, it really currently only
      supports the evb13192.

Second note: The system works (kindof) but if you were to argue that
             it is a mess, I would not contradict you... The system
             makes heavy use of environment variables, that in many
             instances seems redundant. A total rewrite would be great.

The role of the files in this directory is as follows.

hcs08.rules: Basic rules used by TinyOS build system to provide a
             target for hcs08. Used by ../evb13192.target, potentially 
             by others. This file more or less only sets up the TinyOS
             make system to call the file makeEvb13192.sh script upon
             compilation. 

*.extra: Files that define extras to the main target. 
         debug: On windows, starts the hiwave engine, _but_ uses a
         pemicro burner, not recommended currently.
         install: broken, but does build a .s19 file. Use this

makeEvb13192.sh: This script uses ncc to create an app.c file for the
                 MetroWerks CW compiler to compile. This involves
                 calling the ncc compiler, with the right set of
                 include files and paramters, and "demangle" the app.c
                 file: The app.c file created by ncc includes a lot of
                 gcc specific code, which is converted into code that
                 the CodeWarrior compiler can understand.  The last
                 step of this script is to call make, using the
                 MakeHSC08 makefile as input, if the CW compiler is
                 present, otherwise it will use the COMPILEHOST
                 environment variable to contact a compilehost for
                 compilation.

hcs08MangleAppC.pl: This script converts the app.c files created by
                    nesc into an app.c file that can be used by the
                    MetroWerks CodeWarrior compiler. It currently also
		    adds some stuff that is needed for SMAC support. (TODO).
          
MakeHSC08: This Makefile does the actual compilation from app.c file
           into the binary files that can be uploaded to the nodes.
