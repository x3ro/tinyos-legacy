Description:
TestTrivium8 is a TinyOS application which shows how the trivium interface can be used
for 8-bit microcontroller.
The programm creates two internal states which represents the states of a transmitter and
a receiver. A message is encrypted with the transmitter state and then decrypted with the
receiver state.

TestTrivum8AppC.nc :	The configuration file.

TestTrivium8C.nc :		The module file.

sim.py :				The TOSSIM simulation file.

Installation:

If the tivium interface is installed in the TinyOS tree then this program can be compiled with
the command:

make [mote_name]

where [mote_name] is the name of the mote use, for example mica2 or micaz. To used this program
with TOSSIM you can compile the program with the command:

make [mote_name] sim

And then the simualtion is launched with:

pythom sim.py

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
