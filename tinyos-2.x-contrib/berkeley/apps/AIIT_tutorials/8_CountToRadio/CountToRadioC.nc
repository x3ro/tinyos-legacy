/**
 * CountToRadio - A TinyOS application that shows the concept of sending 
 *          a radio message.            
 * 
 * Behavior: 'CountToRadio' program starts a timer at an interval of 1s.
 *           Each time the timer is triggered, this program sends 
 *           a radio message that contains its node ID and counter 
 *           variable. The counter variable is incremented each time 
 *           the timer is triggered. LED is set to last 3-bits of the
 *           counter value.
 *
 *           The goal of this lesson is to write a receiver program
 *           'RadioToCount' program that receives the counter message
 *           and sets its LED as last 3-bits of the receiverd counter
 *           value.
 *
 * Concepts Illustrated:
 * 
 *   Mote-mote communication - TEP111, TEP116
 *                             Tinyos 2.0 tutorial lesson 3
