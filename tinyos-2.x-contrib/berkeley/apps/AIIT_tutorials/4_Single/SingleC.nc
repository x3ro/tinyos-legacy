/**
 * Single - A TinyOS application that shows the concept of sending.
 * 
 * Behavior: On boot, a timer of 1s period is started.
 *           Each time the timer is fired, sampling of the node voltage
 *           is requested. When the node voltage reading is available,
 *           this program sends the voltage reading over serial port.
 *           This program also allows sending an error message and
 *           the temperature reading (to be used at 'Dual' application).
 *         
 *           This program samples only node voltage. 
 *           If you want to extend this program to sample node internal
 *           temperature as well, wire DemoTemperatureSensorC.nc module
 *           to configuration module (SingleAppC.nc). 
 *           
 *           In order to see the debugging message, plug the mote to
 *           a serial port and run the listen client by typing
 *           'source ./run.sh'. The listen client reads a message from
 *           the serial port and prints it on console.
 * 
 * Concepts Illustrated:
 * 
 *   ADC and split-phase          - TEP101
 *                                  Tinyos 2.0 tutorial lesson 5
 *   Mote-PC serial communication - TEP113
