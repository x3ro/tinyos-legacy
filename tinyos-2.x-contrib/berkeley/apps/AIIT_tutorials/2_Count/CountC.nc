/**
 * Count - Second TinyOS application building on Push
 *
 * Behavior: Pressing the user button rotates a counter among 0,1,2 and 3
 *           (initially 0). 
 *
 *           When the counter is 0, no timer is fired.
 *           When the counter is 1, Timer0 (period 1s) is fired.
 *           When the counter is 2, Timer0 and Timer1 (period 2s) are fired.
 *           When the counter is 3, Timer0, Timer1, Timer2 (period 4s) are fired.
 *
 *           When Timer0 is fired, led0 (led LED) is toggled.
 *           When Timer1 is fired, led1 (green LED) is toggled.
 *           When Timer2 is fired, led2 (blue LED) is toggled.
 *
 * Concepts Illustrated:
 * 
 *   Timer - a critical subsystem - TEP102
 *           Virtual resource provided as a parameterized interface.
