/**
 * PrintSerial - A TinyOS application that shows the concept of 
 *               network debugging.
 * 
 * Behavior: When the user button is pressed, a counter variable is
 *           set to (counter + 1) mod 10. 
 *           After that, a debugging  message "Hello <counter>\n"
 *           is sent over the serial port (UART).
 *           
 *           In order to see the debugging message, plug the mote to
 *           a serial port and run the listen client by typing
 *           'source ./run.sh'. The listen client reads a message from
 *           the serial port and prints it on console.
 * 
 * Concepts Illustrated:
 * 
 *   Mote-PC serial communication - TEP113
 *                                  Tinyos 2.0 tutorial lesson 4
