/**
 * Toggle - a minimal TinyOS 2.0 application
 *
 * Behavior: When the user button is pressed, the red LED (led0) is toggled.
 *
 * Concepts Illustrated:
 *   module - the implementation of a functional element that can be 
 *            composed into a larger elements through configurations.
 *            This file, with a name ending in 'M' is an example module.
 *            Modules contain state (variables), internal functions,
 *            functions that implement one side of an interface, 
 *            and tasks that provide logical concurrency (not shown here).
 *            The implementation of a component is in terms of the 
 *            namespace provided by its interfaces.
 *         
 *   configuration - a component that composes a set of components by wiring
 *            together their interfaces.  
 *   commands - externally accessible functions that can be called across
 *            an interface between components, typically to initiate actions.
 *   events   - externally accessible handlers that can be signaled across
 *            and interface between components, typically to notify of 
 *            an occurance.
 *   interfaces - bidirectional collections of typed function signatures for
 *            commands and envents.
 *            This module uses three interfaces provided by lower level
 *            subsystems.
 *            See $TOSROOT/tinyos/tos/interfaces/
