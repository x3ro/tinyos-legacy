/**
 * Raw - A TinyOS application that shows the concept of task.
 * 
 * Behavior: This program samples node voltage whenever timer is fired.
 *           When MAX_READINGS samples are collected, this program 
 *           report the samples over the serial port.
 *
 *           The sampled data can be further processed in a task.
 *           'Smooth' application extends this application as follows:
 *           (1) calculates the statistics:
 *             'Smooth' calculates the minumum, maximum and mean for
 *             sampled data in raw_reading[].
 *           (2) smoothens the sampled data:
 *             'Smooth' calculates the exponential moving average of
 *             raw_reading[] into smooth_reading[].
 *
 *           In order to see the debugging message, plug the mote to
 *           a serial port and run the listen client by typing
 *           'source ./run.sh'. The listen client reads a message from
 *           the serial port and prints it on console.
