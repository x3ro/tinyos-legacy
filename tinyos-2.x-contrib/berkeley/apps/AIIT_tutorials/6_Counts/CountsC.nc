/**
 * Counts - A TinyOS application that shows the concept of sending 
 *          a radio message.            
 * 
 * Behavior: 'Counts' program starts a timer at an interval of 1s.
 *           Each time the timer is triggered, this program sends 
 *           a radio message that contains its node ID and counter 
 *           variable. The counter variable is incremented each time 
 *           the timer is triggered.
 *
 *           'Readings' extends this program by sampling the node 
 *           voltage as well. 
 *         
 *           In order to see the debugging message, a base station 
 *           node needs be prepared. A base station node is a node 
 *           that is programmed with 'BaseStationCC2420' program, 
 *           which forwards all its received radio messages to and 
 *           from the serial port.
 *          
 *           Try program multiple nodes with 'Counts' program and 
 *           see the behavior with a base station node and java client 
 *           application. You can see the debugging messages 
 *           from multiple sensor nodes.
 *
 * Concepts Illustrated:
 * 
 *   Mote-mote communication - TEP111, TEP116
 *                             Tinyos 2.0 tutorial lesson 3
