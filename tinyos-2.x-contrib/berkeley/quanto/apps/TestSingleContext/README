This is a simple test that only has tasks carrying around context.
It is a test to make sure the SingleContext implementation works, even though it
only uses the CPUContext.

The application has three 'activities': main, a, b. A and B alternate to do some
work, and the first one to finish returns to the main activity.

To run, program a mote and keep it connected to the serial port.
Press the user button to start, and then wait for the data to come.
The program logs to memory and after it's done dumps the contents over the uart.
