This application tries to measure the raw costs of changing contexts and recording in memory.
To do so we repeatedly call change context many times. To avoid even the cost of a compare in a loop, we call the cnanges manually.

Result 1: repeated calls to CPUContext.setContext()
Delta (in 32KHz tics):
2 471 0.6643
3 238 0.3357
Average: 2.3357
At 32768 tics per second, this means 71.2 usec
It also means we can log at most 14044 records per second to RAM, if this is all we do.

147 instructions + 2 = 149 inst. At 1 cycle/instruction, the processor would be running at 2.1MHz

Result 2: epic
2437/801
3.0424469413 tics
2437/801*1000000/32768 = 92.8481122222 usec/log

Result 3: epic without the call to icount
1797/801*1000000/32768
68.4645291992

Difference: 24.34us
