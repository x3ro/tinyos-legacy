This is a simple little program to test the behavior of LPL.
We can use it to log what happens in an LPL reception.
We can also test the effect of 802.11 beacons on wake-ups.

It just sits there listening for a packet.
If any packet comes, the green LED goes on and stays on.

The user button controls logging, and resets the led status.

Parameters:
 set the channel and the LPL_INTERVAL (sleep interval) in the
makefile.
 Use BouncePacket on another node with the same channel and interval
to send messages. In that case, beware that BouncePacket will only
send to its 'peer'. One configuration that works is:
   - program id 1 for TestLPL
   - program id 4 for BouncePacket
   - press button on TestLPL (to record log)
   - press button on BouncePacket (sends one packet)
   - press button on TestLPL (to flush the log)

    Bounce will only send one packet, because they won't bounce
back.
