This is an experimental set of serial interfaces for Quanto logging.

The current best one is MySerialWriterC.nc, which implements a streaming 
logging interface.

It has the following features:
+ Requires no configuration
+ Has no AM header, and hence less overhead
+ Accounts for its own CPU time usage, using the 'writer' activity

- Currently requires exclusive access to the UART (I think)
- Only transmits

The negative points are temporary, and can be fixed.
