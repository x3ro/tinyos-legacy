There are three experimental programs here to parse logs, and which
one to use depends on the way the log was generated.

Summary:
 * if you used any of the *MyUART components, don't use
   read_log_am.py
 * if you used QuantoLogMyUARTWriterC, use read_log.py
 * if you used QuantoLogStagedMyUARTC, use read_log_staged.py

The currently preferred way to generate logs is by using
the QuantoLogMyUARTWriterC component, which doesn't require
configuration and does streaming logs over a custom UART stack.
The custom UART stack uses the same framing that the normal stack,
but it DOES NOT USE AM. Less overhead.
The custom UART stack accounts for its own use of CPU time and
schedules Quanto transmissions of log data only when the CPU would
otherwise be idle. 
The disadvantage is that it currently does not work with other
components using the stack, so, no serial for you. It's possible to
make them play together, we just haven't gotten there yet.
For these logs, just use read_log.py.
