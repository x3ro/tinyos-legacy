Summary
* Brought the code up to date with current tinyos-2.x HEAD (as of Feb 13th, 2009)
  Thanks to Thomas Schmid (UCLA) for a patch for the UART and the EnergyMeter

* Added some improvements and fixes, mainly a new streaming logging method over 
  the UART, some improvements on how the scheduler handles returning from interrupts.
  
  
  New scheduler that has a new type of task (TaskQuanto) that runs at low priority
  New serial stack that uses low priority tasks to run Quanto logging
  Switch from interrupt to a scheduled task does not log an extra switch to idle
