Yes, it's called A-MAC in the paper.  Yes, this is the same MAC.

Implementation in tos/chips/cc2420_hotmac
  - see NOTES in that directory for implementation considerations
Test app in apps apps/HotmacBM
  - see EXPERIMENTS for some notes on running tests

--------------------------------------------------

Environment setup:

set TOSCONTRIB to your contrib dir root.  For me, that means
$ export TOSCONTRIB=/Users/stevedh/src/cvs/tinyos-2.x-contrib

add the make extra dir to TOSMAKE_PATH. 
$ export TOSMAKE_PATH=$TOSCONTRIB/berkeley/hotmac/support/make

You can then build using Hotmac with a 
$ make epic hotmac

--------------------------------------------------

Stability notes:

The implementation is reasonably careful, and we were able to run
large-scale tests on it for several hours (multi-hop networks with
CTP) without much trouble.  However, it is still research code and we
have reason to believe there are occasional lockups which we haven't
fully debugged.  Thus, I would not recommend using it in a deployment
without some pretty significant validation; this isn't the kind of
thing you want to crash...
