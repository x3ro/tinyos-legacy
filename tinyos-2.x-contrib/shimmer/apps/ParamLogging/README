a parameterized version of JustFATLogging, which determines which
sensors to sample and at what frequency by reading a configuration
file called sample.cfg -- included here -- on the shimmer's
sd-filesystem.  here's what it looks like:

accel=1
gyro=0
mag=1
ecg=0
emg=0
gsr=0
str=0
sample_rate=50

reminder that there are mutually-exclusive choices due to the
configurations of shimmer daughter cards and the fact that you can
only install one at a time.  the on-board accel can always be chosen
along with daughter-card sensors, of course, but others must be
according to what's on a particular card:

the "9DoF" board has both gyro and magnetometer, so choose either/or
each of the others has just the one circuit, so going in order from
top of the above list to the bottom, if you choose more than one, the
first valid selection will stick and the others will be disabled,
e.g. if you select ecg and gsr, the app will cancel the gsr choice.

two other notes:  due to the board architectures of both shimmer and
9dof, selecting the magnetometer

1) may result in a few dropped mag samples every n-hundred or so, and
2) after sampling the magnetometer, a reset will be required to read
the sd filesystem from the dock.
