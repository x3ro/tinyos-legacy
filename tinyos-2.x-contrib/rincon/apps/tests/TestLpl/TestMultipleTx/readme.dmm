Rx == 0
Tx(1) == 1
Tx(2) == 2
Tx(3) == 3

Tx 1, 2, and 3 will transmit to ID 0, simultaneously
Mote ID 0 should light up red and green after receiving a message from each
individual transmitter.

The packets are full TOSH_DATA_LENGTH packets, and all the bytes are
incrementing for each send.  This will let us know what kind of bit errors
to expect when multiple transmitters are simultaneously transmitting
full packets with no CCA.
