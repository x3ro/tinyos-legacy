Recent updates:
 * ROM footprint cleanup attempt - remove unused parameters in event signals

 * MicaZ corrupted files bug found. The Checkpoint was being wired multiple times
   to the at45db DirectStorage implementation, causing calls to double up and
   corrupt pointers.  Also fixed the at45db's DirectStorage.flush() command to
   be reliable every time.

 * Fixed a bunch of bugs, making it more reliable

 * Added a flags byte to the nodemeta_t and flashnode_t
