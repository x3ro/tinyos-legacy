First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Rui Rocha, for its guidance throughout this last year. I would also like to thank Professor Carlos Almeida for his support and initiative during the many Group of Embedded networked Systems and Heterogeneous Networks (GEMS) meetings that I've attended this last year.

Nevertheless, I would like to thank my MSc students colleagues at GEMS, that in many ways accompanied me during this work and other parallel initiatives. Bruno Gonçalves for his constant initiative on solving other peoples problems, Miguel Barroso for his short but sometimes very wise commentaries, Micael Soares for keeping me on schedule during this past summer, Filipe Perdigão for his support during the time that he was with us and last but not least, PhD candidate José "Mestre" Catela for his somewhat fuzzy commentaries and sharing his life experience with us throughout this last year.
