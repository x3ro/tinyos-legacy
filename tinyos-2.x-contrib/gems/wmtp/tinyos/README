README for WMTP
Author/Contact: gems@leme.org.pt

Description:
WMTP is a modular transport layer architecture for Wireless Sensor 
Networks (WSNs) that not only integrates and enhances the most
common features but also adds new ones that are not commonly found
in WSN transport protocols. WMTP provides the following functions: 
data reliability, congestion control, weighted fairness, flow control,
Quality-of-Service (QoS), throttling, and service discovery awareness.
WMTP's reference implementation was initially developed for TinyOS 1.x,
and was recently ported to TinyOS 2.x.
