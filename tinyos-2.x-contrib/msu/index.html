<h1>Quality-driven Volcano Monitoring using Wireless Sensor Networks</h1>

<p>
The prototype wireless sensor network systems that were deployed on active volcanoes often yielded poor monitoring quality due to the limited sensing capability of low-cost sensors and unpredictable dynamics of volcanic activities. This project aims to develop a quality-driven signal processing (QSP) framework for volcanic signals (e.g., acoustic, seismic and etc). The framework is composed of collaborative, real-time, and energy-efficient algorithms for low-capability sensors as well as advanced information fusion algorithms for base station. Initial results of this project was presented in [1].
