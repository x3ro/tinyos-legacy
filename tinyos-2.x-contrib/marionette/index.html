<h1>Overview of the Marionette for TinyOS 2.x Project</h1>

<p>
Marionette is a tool suite which utilizes RPC to allow functions to be called and variables to be read and modified on an embedded wireless node from a PC.  This specific project serves two purposes: to port the functionality of Marionette from TinyOS 1.x to 2.x, and to add new capabilities to the tool suite.
</p>

<h1>Project Information</h1>

<h2>Completed Functionality</h2>

<p>
This project has nearly reached the full functionality of the TinyOS 1.x version.  It only lacks the ability to communicate with nodes using multi-hop routing.  In addition, an XML-RPC server has been included in Marionette to allow programs to utilize it in a variety of different programming languages and from separate PCs.
</p>

<p>
A unit testing tool has also been developed for Marionette.  It enables programmers to test a given NesC interface and its associated functions, while only requiring the user to give the location of the .nc files and of the node.  All of the NesC code will be generated automatically and installed on the node, then the programmer may treat the returned object as a normal Marionette NescApp.
</p>

<h2>Current Development Efforts</h2>

<p>Callback functionality is currently being developed for Marionette in order to allow listeners to be registered for provided events in a given component. This will greatly expand the number of functions that Marionette is able to interact with.
</p>

<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>
Some areas which we are considering exploring in the future are:<br/>

<ul>
<li>Porting multi-hop routing</li>
<li>Marionette as a macroprogramming development tool</li>
<li>Determining how to allow full or expanded access to NesC Python objects through the XML-RPC interface</li>
</ul>
