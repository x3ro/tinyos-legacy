<h2> Overview </h2>


<p>Rpc is a tool that allows the user to declare a function or
interface with @rpc and then can use the functions from a pc-side tool.
The difference between RPC and AM is that the data is typed. This tool
is meant to be used with the Rpc module in the <a href="Pytos%20Development%20Environment.html" title="Development Environment Demo">Pytos Development Environment</a>, which has a full typing system.  It is not intended for mote-mote communication, which should just use AM.
</p>

<p>Rpc can use various underlying transport mechanisms. By default,
it communicates over drip and drain. A complete sample application can
be found in contrib/hood/apps/TestRpc. The Hood libraries can be found
in tos/lib/Rpc. Some documentation of the API is below.

<a name="API"></a>
<h2> API </h2>


<p>Rpc allows one to declare a function or interface rpc-able with a simple declaration as follows:
</p>


<pre>   provides interface Attribute&lt;uint16_t&gt; as Light @rpc();<br></pre>


<p>or
</p>


<pre>   provides function error_t myFunc(uint8_t param) @rpc();<br></pre>


<p>Once a funtion is tagged @rpc, it should show up in the pc-side
tool. Once an interface is tagged @rpc, all functions in that interface
should show up in the pc-side tool.
</p>

<p>If you are having a problem with RPC, you can use the add the following flag to your makefile:
</p>


<pre>#PFLAGS += -DRPC_LEDS<br></pre>


<p>It indicates that a green light should toggle whenever an rpc
command is received and a red led toggles whenever a response is sent.
A yellow led toggles whenever an error in rpc is detected.

<a name="Commands.2C_Events_and_Pointers"></a>
<h2> Commands, Events and Pointers</h2>


<p>All rpc-able commands and events must be "provided" by the module that tags them @rpc.
</p>

<p>If an interface is tagged @rpc, it's commands will be made
rpc-able if it is "provided" and it's events will be made rpc-able if
it is "used". If a "provided" interface has any events, the RpcM module
will handle these events. This may change the "default" behavior of
those events, which may be undesireable, and a compile time warning is
thrown. The same applies to "used" interfaces that have commands.
</p>

<p>rpc-commands <b>cannot</b> have void* parameters or return
values, which are inherently untyped. They can, however, have typed
pointers as parameters or return values. In such a case, it is assumed
that the pointer is being used as a pass-by-reference, the the receiver
of the data will copy the buffer, and that the true data buffer is
still owned by the origini of the buffer (ie., no buffer swapping with
the pointers!) The use of pointers in rpc commands is not intended to
be the normal mode of use, but rather a hacky way to do things
otherwise not possible.

<a name="Setting_Up"></a>
<h2> Setting Up </h2>


<p>In order to use the API described above, the user must:
</p>


<ol>

  <li> use the new makesystem by setting the Makerules environment variable to point to the tinyos-2.x/support/make/Makerules file
  </li>

  <li> add the following include directories to their makefile 
  </li>

</ol>


<pre>CFLAGS += -I$(TOSROOT)/../tinyos-2.x-contrib/marionette/tos/lib/Rpc<br></pre>


<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">

  <li>wire the RpcC module somewhere in their application
  </li>

  <li>invoke the rpc.extra file in their make process by either
declaring "marionette" on the command line when making the application as
follows
  </li>

</ol>



<pre>make telosb marionette<br></pre>


<p>or adding it to the GOALS variable in their makefile
</p>


<pre>GOALS+=marionette<br></pre>


<p>and finally, include Rpc.h in any file which tags functions with @rpc()
</p>


<pre>includes Rpc; <br></pre>


<p>For problems, the <a href="Pytos%20Installation%20Instructions.html" title="Pytos Installation Instructions">Pytos Installation Instructions</a> setup instructions may contain more details.

<h2> Implementation </h2>


<p>The nesc tools simple create a module called RpcM that receive the
rpc command message, unpack the parameters, call the function, pack the
return value, and send the return message. This file is automatically
generated using the marionette/tools/codeGeneration/generateRpc.pl script, along
with the RpcC.nc file, both of which are stored in the build/platform/
directory. The same script generates the rpcSchema.xml file, which is
used by the pc-side tools.

<a name="Transport_Mechanisms"></a>
<h2> Transport Mechanisms </h2>

Since the TinyOS 2.x version does not yet support Drip and Drain, it is
currently mostly useful when working with a single node connected to a
PC, or
with node(s) within direct reach of a TOSBase.

<p>To get a better idea of what is going on, take a look at the
automatically generated RpcC.nc and RpcM.nc files in
build/&lt;platform&gt;/.
