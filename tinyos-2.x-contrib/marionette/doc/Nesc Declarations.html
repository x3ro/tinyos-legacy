<h2> Overview </h2>



<p>"Nesc Declarations" are things like enums, types, structs, packet
formats, rpc functions, module variables, etc. that the user declares
in a nesc application. The "Nesc Declarations" script tries to avoid
making the user re-declare these things in the pc-side tools by
creating an XML file that contains all the nesc declarations in a
nescApp. This file us currently being used with the <a href="Pytos%20Development%20Environment.html" title="Pytos Development Environment">Pytos Development Environment</a>

<h2> Setting Up </h2>



<p>In order to create the nescDecls.xml file, the user must invoke the
nescDecls.extra file in their make process by either declaring
"marionette" on the command line when making the application as follows
</p>



<pre>make telosb marionette<br></pre>



<p>or adding it to the GOALS variable in their makefile
</p>



<pre>GOALS+=marionette<br></pre>
