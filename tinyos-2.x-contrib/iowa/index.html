<h1>Iowa Projects</h1>

So far, we only have one:  Timesync.

<h2>Rootless Timesync</h2>

<p>
This project is an implementation of <i>rootless</i> timesync.
Most clock synchronization algorithms are rooted to an 
authoritative clock (though perhaps by leader election, 
as Vanderbilt's FTSP does).  The advantage of a rootless
protocol is that it may be better suited to mobile 
nodes.  This project has several interfaces of interest,
please see the doc directory for a README and some 
PDF documents explaining interfaces and operation.
