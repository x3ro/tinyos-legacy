/**
 * This is the PrintfC component. It provides the printf service for
 * printing data over the serial interface using the standard c-style
 * printf command.  The serial port is started is stared upon
 * boot. Data printed using printf are buffered and only sent over the
 * serial line when a '\n' is encounter or when the data accumulated
 * exceeds one packet. Printf statements can be made anywhere
 * throughout your code, so long as you include the "printf.h" header
 * file in every file you wish to use it.
 *
 * This is a modified version of the original printf from tinos-2.x.
