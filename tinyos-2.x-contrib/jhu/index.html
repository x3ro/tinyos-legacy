<h1>Low Power Probing (LPP)</h1>

<p>LPP is lower power technique which can be used to efficiently wake
up a multi-hop network of motes. In the current implementation LPP is
not a complete LPL replacement. The interface is similar with LPL but
simpler and slightly different. More details can be found in
<tt>lpp/README</tt>. In the same directory there two applications,
<tt>TestLppNode</tt> and <tt>TestLppBasestation</tt> which demonstrate
the intend use.</p>

<h1><tt>tinyos.py</tt></h1>

<p><tt>tinyos.py</tt> is a Python implementation of the T2 serial
communication. An earlier version was included in the tools package of
TinyOS 2.0.2 as part of the Deluge T2.</p>

<h1>OneWire Bus</h1>
<p>Framework for communication with devices over the Dallas OneWire
protocol.  Each of the following should contain a README.txt file, and
the nesdocs should be pretty comprehensive.  Much of this code was
adapted from PeoplePower co's OSHAN distribution.  Please respect
their copyright/license notices.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>tos/platforms/telosb</tt> modified to use ADC0 as the
    external onewire data/power.  Change the wiring in
    <tt>tos/platforms/telosb/hardware/onewire/PlatformOneWireInitC.nc</tt>
    if you wish to use a different port. PLEASE NOTE: You *MUST* add a
    pull-up resistor from the onewire bus pin to Vcc.  On a telosb, it
    works fine with ~5k ohm.</li>

    <li><tt>tos/lib/onewire</tt> generic driver code and
    interfaces</li>

    <li><tt>apps/PlatformTests/TestDs1825</tt> for testing with
    multiple DS1825 temperature sensors. The Makefile in this
    directory may be a good starting point for projects wishing to
    include the JHU onewire code  </li>

    <li><tt>apps/TestOneWireBus</tt> for testing the bus multiplexing
    code with a DS1825 temperature sensor.  Please note that the
    device type implementations under dummyOW contain device-specific
    IDs for testing: you'll need to change these to match your
    hardware if you use this app.</li>
