Lower Power Probing (LPP)
=========================

LPP is lower power technique which can be used to efficiently wake up
a multi-hop network of motes. There are two types of nodes in the
network: sensing nodes and base stations. A sensing node keeps the
radio off all the time and probes periodically to see if it needs to
wake up and take part in some communication activity. A basestation is
a node which can trigger the wake up of the whole network.

The probing done by the sensing nodes is performed as follows:
- turn the radio on with auto ack disable
- send a bcast empty packet with ack request set
- if the packet is acked then turn on the auto ack and signal the
  startDone to the upper layers. Otherwise turn the radio off.

To trigger a network wake-up a basestation only needs to turn on the
radio with auto ack enabled.

In the current implementation LPP is not a complete LPL replacement.

Testing
=======

TestLppNode and TestLppBasestation are implementing the sensing node
and the base station. DRIP, the default dissemination mechanism from
T2 is used to keep the network alive until the base station is turned
off.

Semantics
=========

LPP implements a simpler semantic than LPL. The interaction with LPP
is done through two interfaces: SplitControl (start/startDone and
stop/stopDone) and LowPowerProbing (setLocalSleepInterval and
getLocalSleepInterval).

In the initial state the local sleep interval is zero so the
duty-cycling is disabled. A call to setLocalSleepInterval will start
the periodic probing. If the radio is off then the timer is started
right away and if the radio is on then it will first be stopped. When
the probing detects activity the startDone is signaled and a stop is
expected.

The setLocalSleepInterval(0) will disable the duty-cycling and will
leave the radio in it's current state (on if the called is issued
after a startDone or off if it's before the startDone).
