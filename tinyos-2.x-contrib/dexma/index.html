<h1>Tinyos 2.x Contrib repository</h1>
<h2>About dexma</h2>

<h2>What's inside this repository</h2>
<p>While dexCell is still being developped, as a TinyOS developers we have created some small applications and libraries that could be usefull to other developers.</p>
<p>For the moment we offer two small projects.</p>
<h3>dexCell skeleton generator</h3>
<p>Using this perl script you can easy generate a skeleton for a TinyOS based application. Just follow the indications on the screen. There are some bugs when using dissemination. For the moment works fully with telosb / tmote platforms.</p>
<h3>Radio printf</h3>
<p>Based in the printf library (that prints a string over the serial port) this modification sends this string throught a broadcast radio message. Just plug a mote with a BaseStation installed and the Java tools provided by the printf library.</p>
