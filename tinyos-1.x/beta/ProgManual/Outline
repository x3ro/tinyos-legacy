TinyOS Programming Manual

))) Introduction

- TinyOS is
	- operating system and component library for networked sensors
	- research platform
	- multi-platform 
		- note about platform documents (describe 
                platform specifics and components available 
                only on certain platforms)

- Note about this manual: 
	- basic understanding of shell scripts, cvs, etc. are assumed. 
          If there are terms used that you do not understand, 
          google on it.  See Appendix References.

- nesc -- described in the context of the section. 
          Recommend reading the entire nesc manual for 
          thorough understanding of nesc. Many optimizations 
          that you can make that aren't covered here.
	  - why nesc came to be, that is, why the 
          old "decorated c" code of tos 0.x was not 
          sufficient (dave d.)

- other documentation (tutorial, nesdoc)
