/** QueryResults are collections tuples or partially aggregated results, either produced locally or
   received over the network.
<p>
   This interface defines routines to marshall / unmarshall them from tuples and
   byte arrays.
<p>
    Note that QueryResults (or ResultTuples) should not be
confused with Tuples (see TupleIntf) which are simple, fixed width
packed arrays of attribute data collected from local fields. Tuples
are used internally to collect data about sensors -- QueryResults are
sent to neighboring motes and stored in result buffers for external
processing. 
<p>
ResultTuples can be used to get information about specified subtuples of a result.
ResultTuple is defined in TinyDB.h.
They are either aggregates (in which case the individual ResultTuples should be
converted to QueryResults via fromResultTuple and passed to AggOperator for
processing), or 
<p>
Note that you must be careful with QueryResults, since they are sometimes initalized with
pointers into the data structures that they are created from, such that overwriting
their data can cause dangerous things to happen and the underlying pointers can become
invalid when current tuples / buffers are reused.  Situations in which references
may be returned are noted carefully below (usually this is done for large results
for which extra copies would incur a significant memory overhead).
