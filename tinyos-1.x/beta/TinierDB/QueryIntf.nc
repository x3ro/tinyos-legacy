/** Interface for interacting with unparsed Queries, which represent
    queries arriving over the network that have not yet had ascii
    field names translated into schema indices.
    <p>	
    Note that most interaction with queries after network delivery is
    done via ParsedQueryPtrs and ParsedQueryIntf.
    <p>
    This interface provides basic methods to set fields and expressions
    in queries and determine if queries contain all the records needed
    to be converted into ParsedQueries.
