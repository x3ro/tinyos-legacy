- unmount/remount

- block storage needs to track max addr written. should read check this
  (my answer no: it's a very partial check as you can still read lots of
  data that was never written)

- notes for block storage: if any write fails, the whole block must be
  considered invalid (do not commit, cannot retry. not enforced)
  reason: failure may corrupt data from earlier write

- 0 byte r/w/etc ops? allow or fail?


- config storage:
  - when does a "transaction" start? first write, presumably.
    do we want an explict start op?
  - what does a read after some writes but before a commit do?
    o return the new data (but no guarantee of validity?)
    o return the old data
  - behaviour on corrupt data found? (assume "empty"?)

  - is the common model an update to part of the config data, or a complete
    rewrite? or both? (if the latter, maybe a start w/ a "new" vs "copy"
    argument would be useful?)
