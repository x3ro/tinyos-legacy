/**
 * This is a drop-in replacement for TOSSIM's radio stack that operates at
 * the packet, rather than the bit, level. In preliminary testing it
 * performs about 100 times faster than the default bit-level radio stack.
 * Obviously it does not capture the subtleties and behavior of the
 * bit-level simulation, but, it is useful for testing and simulating large
 * networks. 
 *
 * To use this code, all you need to do is add the line
 *   PFLAGS = -I/path/to/tinyos/broken/experimental/mdw/tossim
 * to your application Makefile, then rebuild your application with 'make pc'.
 *
 * This packet-level simulation is compatible with TOSSIM's lossy radio
 * models, so if you are using "-r lossy" or setting link-level loss
 * probabilities with TinyViz, it will work.
