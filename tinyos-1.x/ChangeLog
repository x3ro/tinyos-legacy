	* Changed Telos' baud rate to 57600 from 19200
	  Update your platform.properties file or remove the file
	  and allow SerialForwarder to regenerate the properties file
	  after recompiling net/tinyos/packet/Platform.java
	* TOSBase: New TOSBase implementation from Gilman Tolle.
          New implementation uses a dual buffer swap mechanism instead of a
          buffer pool of 5 buffers in the past implementation.  
          The past TOSBase would lock buffers to the point that 
          under high throughput, each buffer would gradually be 
          unusable until none of the buffers were useable and TOSBase 
          failed.  The new TOSBase works well for receiving and transmitting
          messages to and from the PC and maintains the buffer swap between
          UART and Radio components.  It doesn't use "hidden flags" 
          and is generally easier to decypher its operation.
	* CC2420RadioM reliability and feature updates
	  - Added RadioCoordinator events on send and receive for
	    time synchronization protocols.  Only the startSymbol()
	    event is signalled since the packet-based radio does not
	    have byte() events.  The time from the hardware capture
	    register (16-bit value from a 32768Hz clock) is put into
	    the TX and RX buffer "time" field.
	  - Reliability fixes.  Stop CC2420 from hanging on transmit
	    by flushing the radio.  On receive, look for corrupt packets
	    and lock the receive buffer while it is in use so that the
	    radio can't stomp on its own buffer thereby corrupting the
	    packet.  Fixed the checks for RXFIFO overflow and fixed the
	    RXFIFO flush operation to occur twice.
	  - Known bugs still exist in the implementation under heavy loads.
	    See CC2420RadioM comments for more information.

        * Patched system/TimerM to fix two corner cases that could
          cause single shot timers to fail silently and make timers
          fire wildly (255ms) late. For safety reasons, users can
          no longer request continuous timers with period smaller than
          3ms.
        * Fixed a situation in the CC1000RadioIntM SPI handler where
          a failed task post could cause the system to system to
          enter livelock servicing SPI interrupts. 

2004-07-09 Alec Woo <awoo@cs.berkeley.edu>

	* tos/lib/MintRoute/MultihopWMEWMA.nc
	Fixes to a 16-bit MAC address issue that makes
	MintRoute to fail silently.

	* tos/platform/pc/external_comm.c 
	* tos/platform/pc/external_comm.h

2004-06-11  Michael Demmer  <demmer@cs.berkeley.edu>

	* tos/platform/pc/Nido.nc: 
	Add a -seed= command line option to specify the seed to be passed to
	srand(). If it's not specified, use the return from gettimeofday().

	* tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/script/reflect/Random.java 
	Consolidate all the places within Tython/TinyViz that generate random
	numbers and change them to use a new class called SimRandom. This
	allows a single seed to be passed on the command line, enabling
	repeatable simulations. Pass the seed along to TOSSIM. Add a reflected
	object interface to expose SimRandom to scripts and change the
	existing scripts to use that.

2004-06-10  Michael Demmer  <demmer@cs.berkeley.edu>
	* tos/platform/pc/Nido.nc: 
	Move the call to initializeSockets() until after all the internal
	structures have been set up to avoid a potential race if a new
	connection comes in before we're ready for it.

	Add an event masking capability to TOSSIM / Tython. This allows a
	script to improve the runtime efficiency by eliminating unneeded
	event communication over the event channel. Include an example
	script demonstrating how to temporarily mask certain events and
	re-enable them later.

	add example test scripts for objmover and the sensor api

	* tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/script/reflect:
	update the reflection api to enable manipulation of generic SimObjects
	as well as MoteSimObjects and add a reflection class for the sensor plugin

	* tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/MoteSimObject.java:

	* tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/MotePlugin.java:
	Redraw the screen whenever any SimObject moves, not just MoteSimObjects

	* doc/tython/javadoc:
	update tython javadoc to reflect changes to the reflect api

2004-04-14    <dgay@barnowl.research.intel-research.net>

	* tos/system/TimerM.nc: fix to work with >= 16 timers
	  (or, the perils of assuming that 1<<n works for n>=16)

2004-04-12    <dgay@barnowl.research.intel-research.net>

	* tos/platform/mica2dot/LedsC.nc: mica2dot has only one LED
	
	* tos/platform/mica/hardware.h (TOSH_SET_PIN_DIRECTIONS): 
	* tos/platform/mica2/hardware.h (TOSH_SET_PIN_DIRECTIONS): 
	* tos/platform/mica2dot/hardware.h (TOSH_SET_PIN_DIRECTIONS): 
	  led, flash, etc pin settings moved to respective components
	  (reduce power usage)

	* tos/platform/mica2dot/HPLFlash.nc: 
	* tos/platform/mica2/HPLFlash.nc: 
	  pins set here
	
2004-04-02    <dgay@barnowl.research.intel-research.net>

	* sched.c:
	- n tasks (rather than n-1) to be used in a n-element array
	- change the size of the task queue at compile time 
	(using TOSH_MAX_TASKS_LOG2)
	- remove TOS_empty (apparently unused and not useful)

	To change the size of the task queue, add a 
	  -DTOSH_MAX_TASKS_LOG2=n
	option to your command line, e.g., in Makefile:
	  PFLAGS := $(PFLAGS) -DTOSH_MAX_TASKS_LOG2=4
	to get 2^n tasks. The maximum value allowed is 8.

	  tos/interfaces/Command.h, tos/interfaces/Attr.h,
	  tos/lib/Attributes/Attr.nc, tos/lib/Commands/Command.nc: change
	  schema names to pointers (they are already in the data section, 
	  no need to store twice)

	* apps/Makerules: fix display of ram usage (did not including data
	  segment)

2004-03-06  Michael Demmer  <demmer@cs.berkeley.edu>
