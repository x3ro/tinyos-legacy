 * Note:This components return the battery voltage * 100 so u should have a resolution of
 * about 0.01V in the measurement.
 *
 * NOTE THAT JTAG SHOULD BE DISABLED FOR THIS COMPONENT TO WORK.
 * This is beacause of a hardware problem.U should get the laest version of uisp(u can get it
 * from tinyos website  and try to run
 * fuse_dis--->"uisp -dprog=dapa --wr_fuse_h=0xD9"
 * fuse_en --->"uisp -dprog=dapa --wr_fuse_h=0x19"
