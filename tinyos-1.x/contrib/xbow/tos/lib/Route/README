This version of the multi-hop router
is designed to be a drop-in replacement of the 
TinyOS 1.1 version of lib/Route.  It provied extra debugging
information for use with the Surge Gui.

To use this version of multi-hop routing, change your Makefile
so this directory is in the Nesc search path and remove the
tos/lib/Route directory.

< PFLAGS= -I%T/lib/Route -I%T/lib/Queue -I%T/lib/Broadcast
---
> PFLAGS= -I%T../contrib/xbow/tos/lib/Route -I%T/lib/Queue -I%T/lib/Broadcast

Simply recompile and you will be using the new routing protocol.
