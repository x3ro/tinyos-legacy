README for TestSnooze
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

TestSnooze is a basic application that illustrates the use of
the Snooze component to put the mote into a low power state
for a user-defined period.  The mote will be on, wait for
three Clock.fire() events, and then enter the low power state.
The soft state (variables, etc) of the application are preserved
in SRAM on the microprocessor.  One can notice the internal
private sleep() function causes the mote to sleep for 
4 seconds.
