Instructions for Running the Spaulding Application
==================================================

The following instructions explain how to program the motes and run
the Spaulding applications.

Requirements
============
  (1) Define the environment variable SPAULDINGSRC and have it point
      to the spaulding/src directory.  You should probably put it in
      your statup script.  For example, I have it defined in my .bashrc
      like this:

      export SPAULDINGSRC=/opt/klApps/spaulding/src

  (2) Install the SHIMMER platform (make, SD driver, etc.)
    
      $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/misc
      $ ./makeShimmerPlatform.pl
  
  (3) Make sure you have at least the following versions:

          - TinyOS 1.1.15  (NOTE: The MSP430 sampling interface changed
                            quite a bit from, which is the main reasons 
                            for version incompatibility)
          - NesC 1.2.x
          - Java 1.5.x (otherwise known as 5.x)


(1) Program the Motes
=====================
  (a) Install TOSBase
  -------------------
  - Install TOSBase from the Spauling tree on one mote.  This mote
    will be attached to the laptop and will act as the gateway between
    the motes and the laptop.
    NOTE: X is the windows COM port minus 1. Type "motelist" to see
    the com port    

    $ motelist
    $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/lib/tosBase
    $ make telosb install.0 bsl,X  

  (b) Install the Sensor motes
  ----------------------------
  - Install the sensor motes.  IMPORTANT, the first mote should be
    installed with the ID of the time synchronization root.  By
    default it is 10.  However, it changed by editing
    FTSP_STATIC_ROOT_ID in the file $SPAULDINGSRC/driver/Makefile.common.in

    $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/driver
    $ make telosb install.10 bsl,X

  - Install the rest of the sensor motes in a similar way.

  (c) Install the ViconSync mote (optional)
  ------------------------------
  - Program and install the ViconSync mote (optional)

    $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/viconSync
    $ make telosb install.100 bsl,X  - Start the java logger

 

(2) Run the Spaulding Application (Java side)
=============================================
  (a) The Main SpauldingApp java GUI
  ----------------------------------
  - Complie the Java GUI.  This needs to be done only once
   
    $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/gui
    $ make cleanall
    $ make

  - Start Serial Forwarder.  NOTE: COMX is now the value shown by
    motelist without the minus 1!
  
    $ java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@COMX:telos

  - Run the GUI

    $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/gui
    $ make run

  - Additionl note:
    Wait until all motes show up and they all have the "Time synched"
    checkbox checked (this indicates that they are synchronized to the
    root node).  At this point you can run a SamplinsSession by
    adjusting the "Duration" and then clicking "Start".  For each
    SamplingSession, the gui issues a start sampling command to all
    motes, and after the set duration it reliably downloads the
    samples.  The data for SamplinSession is stored in the following,
    where <SAMPLINSESSIONDATE> is the directory created for a
    particular sampling session.

    $SPAULDINGSRC/gui/samplingSession/<SAMPLINSESSIONDATE>


  (b) The ViconSync logger and command sender
  -------------------------------------------
    - Start a new SerialForwarder.  IMPORTANT, change the "Server
      port" number to something different than the default
      (e.g. PORTX=9002).  COMX points to your ViconSync mote.

      $ java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@COMX:telos

    - Start the ViconSyncLogger

      $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/viconSync/viconSyncLogger
      $ make
      $ MOTECOM=sf@localhost:PORTX make run
      
    - Send commands to the ViconMote through the ViconSync
      SerialForwarder!

      $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/viconSync/viconSyncLogger
      $ MOTECOM=sf@localhost:PORTX java ViconSyncCmd
      
     
  
(3) View Collected Data
=======================

  - To view the samples for the last sampling session, run the command
    below.  <nodeID> is the ID of the mote you want to plot. This
    script will grab the last sampling session directory, plot and
    display the samples for the specified mote.  For example, to view
    the samples for node 10, do the following:

    $ cd $SPAULDINGSRC/gui/samplingSession
    $ $ ./plotLastDir.pl 10


LEDs Meaning
============
  - Mote turned on:       blinks green x 3
  - Data collection:      blinks orange infrequently (100 ms every 10 sec)
  - Stop data collection: blinks orange x 3
  - Error:                togles red LED 1 sec. or turns on all leds
