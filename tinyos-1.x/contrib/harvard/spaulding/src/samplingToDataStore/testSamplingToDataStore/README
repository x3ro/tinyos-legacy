This directory contains an example of how to wire the
MultiChanSampling, SamplingToDataStore, and DataStore components.  The
wiring for the final Driver program should be very similar.

To Note:
========
 - By default, the DataStore now formats the flash every time
   DataStore.init() is called.  This makes things a bit simpler, at the
   cost of a longer init() cycle.  This can be disabled by enabling
   the compile time flag DS_FORMAT_DISABLED in the Makefile.

 - For the final Driver, you will want most or all the CFLAGS
   variables in the Makefile under "For Debugging" to be disabled.
   If disabled, the BLOCK_DATA_SIZE, DS_NBR_BLOCKS_PER_VOLUME,
   DS_NBR_VOLUMES will be set to the correct values to use the entire
   flash.  When debugging, it's useful to define a smaller flash for
   printing amongst other things.
 
 - When BLOCK_PRINT_SAMPLECHUNK is enabled, Block_print() will
   interpret and print the Block data part as a SampleChunk.
