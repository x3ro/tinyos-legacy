MultiTimer is a component multiplexing both MicroTimer (i.e. timers down to
the resolution of the clock) and SysTime functionality onto the same
MSP430/AtMega128 timer.

I'm not sure we need the fine-grained timing capability here, but FTSP wants
the high-resolution timers.  At least for now.  We may back up to using the
32kHz oscillator as that may provide us with plenty of resolution.  We'll
see.  For now this is here.  It provides two interfaces: MicroTimer (included
in this directory) and SysTime, defined in the standard TinyOS tree.

12 May 2005 : GWA : Dummy SysTimeM.nc component added to eliminate compiler
errors associated with redefining the interrupt.

25 May 2005 : GWA : Added IFDEF's for TelosB.
