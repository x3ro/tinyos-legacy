README for PirToLeds
Author/Contact: Prabal Dutta 

Description:

PirToLeds is an application that periodically samples the PIR sensor
and displays the highest 3 bits of the raw PIR ADC reading to the 
LEDs, with YELLOW being the most signficant bit and RED being the 
least significant bit.  If you stand very, very still, you should see
either the YELLOW LED only (4) or the RED AND GREEN together (3) 
turning on, or you might see oscillations between these two states.
Thereafter, when you move around, you should see the other LED 
combinations turning on and off, indicating your motion is causing 
the PIR sensor to change its output, which is then reflected in the 
LEDs.
