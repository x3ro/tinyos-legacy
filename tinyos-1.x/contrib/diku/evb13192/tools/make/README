This is the make system support files needed for the 13192 EVB
platform (evb13192 between friends!).

The support files consists of

a) The evb13192.target file
b) The support files for the hcs08 MCU

a) Is used by the TinyOS build system to define the target. To provide
   this target it includes the hcs08/hcs08.rules file. It also sets
   needed include files and path for actual compilation. If you need
   to include files from other directories, set it up in here.

b) Includes the various files needed for compilation for the hcs08
   files, including the calls to the MetroWerks CodeWarrior, and so
   on. Conceptually you can think of the chain as this:
   evb13192.target -> hcs08.rules -> makeEvb13192.sh -> MakeHSC08

See the README file in this directory for more information about the
setup.
