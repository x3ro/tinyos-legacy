Todo list, 20050131, madsdyd@diku.dk

Note, also check the source.

- If feasible: Write ANSI compatible startup code in TinyOS: Setting
  up the stack, copying down the variables from flash, zeroing out
  global variables.

- Make sure all ports are pulled up/down if they are unneeded.

- Make sure that all busspeed are set equally, and that it makes sense
  to run 16 Mhz. (Note, the 802.15.4 stack _requires_ 16 MHz
  busspeed).

- Modify the 802.15.4 interfaces to return error codes.

- TOSH_u_wait and friends is broken, I think.

- Redesign the way the clock is used, because we may need to change
  clock settings from other modules.

- 802.15.4 stakc: Make sure that no atomic statements are more than 50
  instructions... how (10 us each 64 us)

- Enum sizes: We currently use 32 bit for everything, because of the
  dbg statements, but that is quite wasteful.

- Clean up linker scripts.

- Document the problems the Net::SSH::Perl on the compile server.

- Fix docs targets to work without smac support (look in docs.extra,
  must be some env to set).

- Make TOSBase work - need CRC check on receive (send OK).
