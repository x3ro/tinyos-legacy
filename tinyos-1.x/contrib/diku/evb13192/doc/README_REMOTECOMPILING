+ WindowsFTDIDrivers.tar.gz
  Archive containing Windows drivers for the FTDI chip on the
  13192EVB. 

+ bootloader-v6-host.tar.gz
  Archive containing the source for the bootloader host program, as well as a
  generic Windows binary and a Linux binary built on Mandrake 10.0.

+ miniterm.tar.gz
  Minimal terminal program for Linux. Useful instead of minicom, which
  can be a pain to configure.

+ tos-evb13192-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
  TinyOS files that includes support for the 13192EVB board.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Setup instructions


+ Install TinyOS as per the instructions on the homepage.

We will refer to the root of your TinyOS source directory as TOSROOT.

Make a backup copy of the file TOSROOT/tos/system/tos.h (or perhaps
the entire tos tree, if you feel so inclined.

Unpack the file tos-evb13192-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz into TOSROOT. All but one
file (tos.h) should go into TOSROOT/contrib/diku/evb13192


+ Install the host bootloader program

You need the host bootloader program to program a node. Unpack the
archive, and install the executable that fits your platform into your
path. You may wish to recompile the program to your platform: On Linux
you issue "make" in the source directory - I have no clue what you do
on Windows...


+ Windows: Install the FTDI drivers.

Windows will prompt you for a driver the first time you insert the
EVB13192 device into an USB port. Unpack the tar.gz file (winzip will
do fine, otherwise use the Cygwin CLI tar program), and point Windows
to the file it requires in the dir where you unpacked the drivers.


+ Linux: Compile/install miniterm

We find minicom overkill for just getting a view on what is sent to
you by the node. Miniterm is a simplistic terminal program that is
very esay to use. Try it out if you have problems getting minicom to
work. Compilation is easy: unpack the archive, enter the dir, type
"make".


------------------------------------------------------------
* Compilation instructions

To compile a demo application, go to
TOSROOT/contrib/diku/evb13192/apps/TestUart. Here you should "source"
the file TOSROOT/contrib/diku/evb13192/MakeSetup:

$ . ../../MakeSetup

The file MakeSetup sets up required environment variables to allow
compilation. These are
COMPILEHOST
TOSDIR
MAKERULES
TOSMAKE_PATH

They can all be overriden by using e.g.
$ export TOSDIR=/some/place/weird/that/nesc/does/not/know/about

You should only have to change TOSDIR, and only if you did something
non-standard during installation. Please note, that TOSDIR is (for
historical reasons) _NOT_ the same as the TOSROOT we defined above,
but rather TOSROOT/tos/ - some of you will be bitten by this, when you
install the nesc compiler (if you do it from source), so take care.

After sourcing MakeSetup, you can compile:

$ make evb13192

Other targets are available, try:

$ make evb13192 help
$ make evb13192 install
$ make evb13192 docs


+ Compilation requirements

- "plain" target

The overall compilation process is like this: All the .nc files are
translated into a C file (build/evb13192/app.c) by the NesC
compiler. This file needs to be translated into a binary
file. Normally for TinyOS, this is done by a gcc backend for the
MCU. Unfortunately, no gcc compiler exists for the MC9S08GT60. We have
access to a Windows compiler that can perform this step, but due to
licensing issues, we can not hand it out. Instead, the make file will
automagically contact a host on the amigos net that will perform this
compilation step for you using a compiler we refer to as CW, and
create the necessary files. Should compilation fail, then you will be
notified.

The program "curl" is used to contact the host, post the request and
get the response. This program is available on most Linux systems, and
can be installed as a package under Cygwin (which is installed by the
TinyOS installation program under Windows). Proxies can be configured
if necessary, consult the curl documentation.

We again stress that the system may have bugs/flaws - please do not
hesitate to contact Mads Bondo Dydensborg on madsdyd@diku.dk if you
think you have spotted problems with the system.


- install target

As the "plain" target, but will output a line with the syntax for
calling the bootloader host program under Linux (under Windows you
should replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your comport _number_, e.g.:
"3"). More about using the bootloader below (after installation
instructions).


- docs target

This target creates documentation for the program you have
compiled. You probably need the doxygen program, and the graphviz/dot
package to get the fancy component graps. Recommended.


+ More compilation notes

During the NesC compilation you will get a number of the following
warnings:

warning: `interrupt' attribute directive ignored
warning: return type of `main' is not `int'

At this point it is safe to ignore them.

The CW compiler will issue a number of warnings/information too. The
INFORMATION lines can usually be ignored. The CW compiler will
typically issue a warning about main not returning an int - this can
be ignored too.

+ Compilation output

After a succesful "make evb13192 install", the following files will be
present in build/evb13192:

app.c          : The app.c that the CW compiler have translated
app.c.orig     : The app.c file that the NesC compiler created
                 This file have been "mangled" into app.c.posted
app.c.posted   : The app.c file that was posted to the CW compiler
                 Should be exactly the same as app.c!
app.exe        : Compiled app.c program in binary format, linked
	         with any other .o files that have been included.
app.lst        : Assembly dump of app.c - Good for debugging
app.map        : Map file: describes sections, dependencies, call
                 graphs.
app.o          : app.c object file.
app.pre        : app.c preprocessed file
app.s19        : s19 version of app.exe
compile.tar.gz : All output (files, etc) from the CW compiler 
EDOUT          : An annoying file that I so far have not gotten CW to
                 stop producing...
http_headers   : The headers returned to curl during compilation.
main.s19       : For now, equal to app.s19 - may change
OUTPUT         : The stuff the CW progs wrote to stdout + stderr
                 during compilation

You can often learn things about your program by looking at these
files. Please note however, that if compilation fails, not all files
may be present, and that you should sometimes do a "make clean" before
compilation to ensure that you are not looking at outdated output
files alongside with fresh ones.

+ Compiling with the lighttemp sensorboard or SimpleMac support

In order to support the lighttemp sensorboard, you need to make the system
aware of this board, by adding a line like this to your Makefile:
SENSORBOARD=lighttemp

In order to use the SimpleMac component, we need to use a veriable
called ENVIRONMENT, like this:
ENVIRONMENT=SimpleMac
You still need to create a TinyOSconfiguration that includes the
SimpleMac component, etc.


A complete Makefile for an application called "MyApp" may the look like this:
------------Makefile start-----------
# This application assumes the 13192EVB board and the lighttemp sensor
# board, and uses the SimpleMac component.

PLATFORMS=evb13192
ENVIRONMENT=SimpleMac
SENSORBOARD=lighttemp
COMPONENT=MyApp

include ../../../../../apps/Makerules
-------------Makefile end------------

------------------------------------------------------------
* Using the bootloader/programmer

Documentation for the bootloader is available at:
http://www.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/app_note/AN2295.pdf

You should not need to consult this documentation as we present an
overview of the method used to program here:

Note : Because your node will send output to the UART when the
bootloader tries to connect to it, you need to program using the
following steps:

a) Press and hold the reset switch on the board
b) Run the bootloader program: 
---------
$ hc08sprg /dev/ttyUSB0 build/evb13192/main.s19
hc08sprg - Developer's Serial Bootloader for HC(S)08 - $Version: 1.0.22.0$
FC protocol versions supported: 1 (HC08), 2 (S08), 3 (large HC08)
See Freescale Application Note AN2295.

Waiting for HC08 reset ACK...
---------
c) Release the reset switch - the bootloader will calibrate, then ask
for your confirmation before programming:
---------
Waiting for HC08 reset ACK...received 0xfc (good).
Calibration break pulse sent. Count: 1
Bootloader protocol version: 0x02 (read command supported)
Bootloader version string: GB/GT60
System device ID: 0x02 [MC9S08(GB/GT)(32/60)] rev. 4
Number of memory blocks: 2
Memory block #1: 0x1080-0x17FF
Memory block #2: 0x182C-0xFDBF
Erase block size: 512 bytes
Write block size:  64 bytes
Original vector table: 0xFFC0-0xFFFF
New vector table:      0xFDC0-0xFDFF

Are you sure to program part? [y/N]:
---------
d) press y<enter> - this will commence programming:
---------
Are you sure to program part? [y/N]: y
Memory programmed:          100%
Memory verified:            OK
---------

Note: Sometimes a byte or two can be latched on the serial port. In
this case, the bootloader program will abort. Please retry a few
times.

Note: If you use the bootloader program under cygwin, please note that
the output gets buffered (or something), which means that the program
prints a message that you can not see, then waits for your
input. Press "y" to get going, or run the program in a cmd.exe shell.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Getting the Uart output

You should use a terminal program such as hyperterm (Windows) or
minicom/miniterm under Linux. Connect to the port you are connected to
(most likely /dev/ttyUSB0 under Linux (check dmesg), and com3 under
Windows), using 300 bps, 8 bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1).
NB: When you are using the SimpleMac component, the com speed is 38400
- the rest is unchanged.

Under Linux, you start the miniterm program something like this:

$ miniterm -b300 -d/dev/ttyUSB0

Because of clock problems, you may experience framing errors, which
means that the output data is "out of sync". Press reset on the board
to force synchronization.

The application that is programmed on your board to begin with,
outputs data like this:

TestLightTemp online
Light: 0x01D7 - Temp: 0x0104
Light: 0x0269 - Temp: 0x0104
Light: 0x0275 - Temp: 0x0105
Light: 0x029E - Temp: 0x0105

when you press the reset switch, and it will toggle the red led
approximately each second.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Working with multiple nodes

When you work with multiple nodes, it is nice to be able to tell the
difference between them, both during debugging and when the programs
run.

In order to be able to visuall tell the difference between the nodes,
you can put a piece of tape on the backside, and write with a soft
filtpen on it.

For a TinyOS program, the variable TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS can be used. This
value can be changed, using the tos/scripts/set-mote-id program, prior
to uploading the program on the node:

[TestSMACConsole]$ make evb13192 && for id in 1 2 3 4 5 ; do ../../tools/scripts/set-mote-id $id ; done

Assuming compilation went well, you will get  anumber of files in
build/evb13192, that have different ids:

[TestSMACConsole]$ ls  build/evb13192/app.s19*
build/evb13192/app.s19    build/evb13192/app.s19.2  build/evb13192/app.s19.4
build/evb13192/app.s19.1  build/evb13192/app.s19.3  build/evb13192/app.s19.5

Each of these files can now be uploaded to a different node.
