To remember:
------------
Output sometimes halts on boot - wiring order wrong?
Concurrency, SetTrxState.request
Look into RX_MODE, etc. again
Look into whether buffering is needed (currently semi-does, but probably shouldn't)
- an example could be the CCA-request/confirm
- should there be a mutex?
What should the CCA threshold be? Ieee802154PhyM.nc
What about phyTransmitPower? mc12192ControlM.adjustPAOutput?
What about phyCCAMode?
Consider what to do about power management. An extension to the standard might be needed (5.4.5)
Maybe add TRX_POWEROFF, TRX_DOZE and TRX_SLEEP, and let TRX_OFF be mc13192 radio idle mode.
