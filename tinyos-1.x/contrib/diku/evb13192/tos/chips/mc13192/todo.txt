* Fix even number of TX byte problem in packet mode.
* Currently we get an error when receiving a packet right after
  a packet with crc error is received.
* Test CCA and ED in stream mode.
* Make interrupt handler reentrant below fast action, to make it possible
  to react to lolock and timer interrupts, even when doing stream operations.
