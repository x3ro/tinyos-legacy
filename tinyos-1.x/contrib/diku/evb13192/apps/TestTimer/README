This idirectory contains 3 test applications:
    1. To test timer interface provided by TimerC.nc and TimerM.nc 
       This implementation does not wire in LogicalTime and 
       does not have Time, TimeUtil and TimeSet interfaces. 
        t is light-weighted. 
    2. To test the above interface with radio running at a fast rate --
       every 40 ms per message
    3. Test Timer interface provided by LogicalTime module. 
       Since LogicalTime provides not only Timer interface but also
       Time, TimeUtil and TimeSet interfaces for TimeSync purpose, 
       It produces a larger kernal. 



Description:

These are TonyOS applications. 
They test the Timer interface. 
Each creates 3 different timers and haddles the timer events  

If you wish to do you own tests, you can modify the code
and create difference test scenarioes. 
If you want to use the timer interface in your application, 
you can use this app. as an example. 

This application is not part of Tiny OS tutorial.
