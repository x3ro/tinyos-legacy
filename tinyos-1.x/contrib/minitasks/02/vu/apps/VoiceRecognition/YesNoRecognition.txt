DESCRIPTION:

This component recognizes "YES" and "NO" audio commands. Hearing a "YES" it will
turn on the green LED and turn off the red LED. Hearing a "NO" it will turn on
the red LED and turn off the green LED. It is constantly listening, if it hears a 
big enough noise then it turns on the yellow LED for approximately 0.7 seconds and
starts analyzing the voice signal.

This component uses the ZeroCrossings component which we use for other purposes too,
for example to distinguish different types of weapons. That component automatically 
turns off and on the radio stack, even though the YesNoRecognition application 
does not need this feature. Thus you have to copy the RadioSuspend.nc and 
RadioSuspendC.nc files to this directory (or put them into the ../RadioSuspend 
directory) before you can compile this application.

The algorithm uses a very simple zero crossing histogram analysis.
