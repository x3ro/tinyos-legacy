VerifyClock1:

The VerifyClock1C component is used to determine the actual interrupt rates for various scales. 
This helped to verify the documentation of timers in ATmega103 (and ATmega128). You need to build
and install two versions of the VerifyClockC and compare the rates they blink at. 
They should blink about once per second.
