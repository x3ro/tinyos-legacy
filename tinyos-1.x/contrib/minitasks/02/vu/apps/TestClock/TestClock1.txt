TestClock1:

The TestClock1C component verifies that the real time clock (local time),
as returned by the LocalTime.read() method, is monotonic and does not jump. 
In a busy loop we continuously read the current time and compare it to the
previous value. On the LED we display the maximum positive time difference
for 2 seconds (should be 3 jiffies) and the minimum time difference 
for 1 seconds (should be 1 jiffies).
