README for the voltage tester application:

Author/Contact: gabor.pap@vanderbilt.edu (Gabor Pap, ISIS, Vanderbilt)

DESCRIPTION:

Low batteries usually cause mystical behavior (RF problems, freezing, etc.).
This application uses the Voltage module (shipped with TinyOS 1.x) to measure
battery voltage. The results are then sent through the serial port, and 
displayed on the PC by a Java GUI. During the measurement, the mote runs a 
busy-wait loop to ensure consistent power consumption.

FILES:

VoltageAppC.nc VoltageAppM.nc implement the sampling and data forward to the 
UART.

VoltageAppMsg.h contains the sampling rate plus the message structure for this 
application. 

THE JAVA PROGRAM:

The java program (MeasureVoltage.java) displays the voltage level in a graphical
way. The program connects to the serialport using SerialStub. It is configurable
in many ways, use: "java isis.nest.util.MeasureVoltage -help" for more info! 
The CircularBuffer.java is also necessary! 

TUNABLE PARAMETERS:

The VoltageApp component can be configured by changing the following value in 
VoltageAppMsg.h:

SAMPLERATE: This determines the ACD sampling rate.

TESTING:

The RED led is on when the application is running, the GREEN blinks when
sampling.
