TestTimer1:

The TestTimer1C component does a very primitive verification of the Timer 
implementation. It starts two timers, one with 2 Hz (32768/16384), and another 
with 10.922Khz (32768/3). From the first timer we blink the red LED at every 
tick. From the second timer we blink the yellow LED at every 5461 (16384/3) 
ticks. The two LEDS should blink at the same rate (there is a small difference, 
because 3*5461 = 16383 != 16384).
