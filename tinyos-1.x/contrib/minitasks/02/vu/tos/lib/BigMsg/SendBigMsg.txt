SendBigMsg:

DESCRIPTION:

The SendBigMsg component allows large memory buffers (few KBs) to be sent back 
to the base station. The memory region does not have to be continuous, which
allows the use of circular buffers on the motes. The SendBigMsg component 
automatically cuts and pastes the data of the memory region into regular
message packets. The packets contain a sequence number and are transmitted 
in order. Each packet is retried several times if no acknowledgment is
received. The base station must run the GenericBase application which forwards 
all messages to a PC connected to the base station. A java programm 
(PrintBigMsgs) dumps the messages to the standard output, one line per 
big message.

THE JAVA PROGRAM:

The java program (PrintBigMsgs) displays each BigMsg in a line. The program 
can connect to a SerialForward application, or can use the serial port directly.
The program does not display corrupted or partial messages.

TUNABLE PARAMETERS:

The SendBigMsg component can be configured by changing the following value in 
BigMsg.h:

BIGMSG_RETRY_COUNT: The number of retries of each packet. If no acknowledgment
is received for this many times, then the rest of the big message is not 
transmitted. The default value is 5.
