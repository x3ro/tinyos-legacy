DESCRIPTION:

The AcousticBeacon component is used to send out a radio signal followed by one or more
acoustic signals. Since precision timing is required in most acoustic ranging applications
we disable the radio right after transmitting the radio signal. The length of the buzzes
and the delays between them can be programmend by the setTiming command.

The receiving of the acoustic signal is done in AcousticSampler and AcousticMultiSampler.
