BroadcastPolicy:

DESCRIPTION:

The BroadcastPolicy module is the most simple policy. It resends every message
it heard exactly once. It remembers the packet for 5 seconds till it last heard 
it. This ensures that same data packet is not resent if it has already 
passed through this node.

This particular implementation does not wait before resending, but it trivial to 
modify it in such a way that it waits up to a second before resending the packet. 
This would make collisions less likely. However, the default implementation seems 
to work, which just shows that the radio collision avoidance works.
