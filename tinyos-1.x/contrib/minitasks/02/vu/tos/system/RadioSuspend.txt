RadioSuspend:

Author/Contact: miklos.maroti@vanderbilt.edu (Miklos Maroti, ISIS, Vanderbilt)

DESCRIPTION:

The RadioSuspend component allows to temporaly shot down the wireless communication 
stack. This crude hack is required because the GenericComm.StdControl interface
(in the tinyos-1.0 distribution) does not work properly: the stop() and stop() 
methods do not stop and restart the stack. 

Robert Szewczyk indicated that a properly working GenericCommm can be found on
the SourceForge CVS in the PowerManagementDemo, which will eventually be the default
implementation. You probably want to develop application using that and not 
our RadioSuspend component.

TESTING:

Two testing components are included. The first, TestRadioSuspend1C.nc, checks if
we can send a message, suspend radio, resume the radio from a timer and restart this
sequence again. The second component tests the maximum interrupt rates that we can 
achieve with the stack running/ with the stack suspended and without the stack.
