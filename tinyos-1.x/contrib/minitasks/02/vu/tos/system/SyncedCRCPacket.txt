README for SyncedCRCPacket

Author/Contact: janos.sallai@vanderbilt.edu (Janos Sallai, ISIS, Vanderbilt)

DESCRIPTION:

This component provides a packet oriented communication layer that provides higher reliability with communication over the UART. It synchronizes the packets with a 2 byte preamble and uses CRC for integrity checking.

FILES:

SyncedCRCPacket.nc contains the implementation of the packet layer.

UARTSyncedCRCPacket.nc provides SyncedCRCPacket's functionality over the UART.

GenericComm.nc is a slightly modified version of the native GenericComm component. While the native implementation uses NoCRCPacket for serial communication, our version leverages the SyncedCRCPacket component.

USAGE:

Since SyncedCRCPacket uses a different protocol, we need to use a replacement serial stub (isis.nest.util.SyncedCRCSerialPortStub)instead of the native net.tinyos.util.SerialPortStub in the java programs.

Similarly, the modified version of the native SerialForward application has to be used with motes programmed with UARTSyncedCRCPacket. This can be found in the isis.nest.sf java package.
