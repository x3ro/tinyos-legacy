package net.tinyos.magtracking.*

README:

The tools in this directory allow you to interact with motes running the code found in: "minitasks/02/ucb/magtracking_demo", which you can checkout from sourceforge similarly to the tinyos-1.x directory

To create the tools in this java package, type make twice (2X).  The makefile uses MIG to generate message classes that interact with the code in tinyos1.x/lib/Ranging.  MIG (message interface generator) usually goes into the NesC code found in those directories to figure out the structure of the packets they are generating/expecting and then generates Java message objects with a matching structure.  However, because magtracking uses a dynamic message structure, MIG doesn't quite work.  The file Packets.h is a hack to give MIG the packet formats in MagTracking.  We need this becuase the packet structures used in the routing
architecture are dynamic (not statically defined as MIG expects).
Therefore, this file needs to be kept up to date as the routing
stuff changes.

There are many ways to use the message objects created by MIG.  One such way is found in the tinyos1.x/doc/tutorial/matlab.html tutorial.

To use the ranging message objects from Matlab:
1) open matlab
2) change to your /tinyos1.x/tools/matlab/contrib/magtracking directory
3) run 'startMagtrackingGui' to setup matlab to use these tools
