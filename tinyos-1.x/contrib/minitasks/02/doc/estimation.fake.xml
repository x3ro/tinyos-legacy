<p>
This component aggregates sensor readings among a group of motes. The protocol
for data measurement and aggregation is application-specific and transparent to
the rest of demo code. If a target is detected, the component fires a
TargetPosition event on the motes attached to the pursuers. The event passes
the address of a target and a target identifier. The protocol will attempt to
use the same identifier consistently to refer to the same target. This is
accomplished with the help of the group management component described in
Section 4.  A higher-level protocol can be used to compile a list of all
identified targets and their current locations.

<p>
Estimate Target depends on the PacketRouting component. Especially, it will
need to use the RouteMobile interface to deliver the target information to the
pursuers. The target estimation component also interacts with the location
service. It needs the location information to calculate the position of the
target using the positions of the detecting motes.

module PrototypeEstimateTargetM {
    provides {
        interface TargetPosition;
    } uses {
        interface ReceiveMsg;
        interface SendMobile;
    }
}

interface TargetPosition {
   event result_t TargetPosition(location_t position; char target_id);
}
