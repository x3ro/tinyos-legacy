In poking around further, I realized that it might not be easy to get 
animations out of the GUI.  There are simple tools for doing this where 
you are basically generating plots.  I don't know this for sure.

Given that Cory has built on matlab functions for injecting and parsing 
packets, it is not too hard to just build up a matlab data structure 
containing the values or sequence of values that you want to see.  Once 
it is a matlab variable, it is pretty easy to build plots and sequences 
of plots that form movies.  Here is a simple piece of matlab code that
does that.  nodes is a vector of positions.  M ends up being the movie 
object.  If you are inside matlab, the movie object is what you want. 
If you want to see it outside matlab, you can generate an avi file. 
This does both.

node = struct('x',0,'y',0,'id',0)
node(1).x = 5.2
node(1).y = 3.4
node(1).id = '1'

node(2).x = 2.2
node(2).y = 5.4
node(2).id = '2'

node(3).x = 8.2
node(3).y = 3.1
node(3).id = '3'

n = length(node)
s = 0.5
nframes = 50;

x = [node.x]'
y = [node.y]'

h = plot(x,y,'.');
set(h,'MarkerSize',18);
axis([0 20 0 20])
axis square
grid off

for k = 1:nframes
    drawnow
    x = x + s*randn(n,1);
    y = y + s*randn(n,1);
    set(h,'XData',x,'YData',y)
    M(k) = getframe;
end

movie2avi(M,'nodemove')
