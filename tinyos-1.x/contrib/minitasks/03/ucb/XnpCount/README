README for CntToLedsAndRfm

Description:

XnpCount is an extension of CntToLedsAndRfm that can take network
reprogramming request.

CntToLeds maintains a counter on a 4Hz timer; it displays the lowest
three bits of the counter value on its LEDS. The red LED is the least
significant of the bits, while the yellow is the most significant. It
also sends out each counter value in an IntMsg AM packet.

XnpCount stops Counter component when it receives network
reprogramming request to make the application not compete
for radio resources with network programming. XnpCount starts 
Counter again after it is notified of successful network 
reprogramming termination.

Tools:
