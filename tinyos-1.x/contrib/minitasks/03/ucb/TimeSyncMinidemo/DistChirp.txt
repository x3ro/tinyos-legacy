DESCRIPTION:

This is a small demo of the timesync component. You have to program 8 motes with
node ids 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Put them in a small circle. They should blink the red LED
in order and in circle. When they blink, they also chirp, which make easy to verify
that nothing is wrong.

NOTES:
Can only compile for platforms vumica2 and vumica2dot
