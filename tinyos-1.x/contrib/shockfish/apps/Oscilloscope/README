README for the TinyNode Oscilloscope application

Acknowledgement: This app is closely derived from MoteIV's Oscilloscope. [Including this very README!]


Description:

The Oscilloscope application senses all of the sensors on Moteiv
devices and communicates the sensor values over the radio to a 
base station running the TOSBase application. 

Supported sensors 
  On TinyNode:
    - Voltage Supply Monitor
    - TI MSP430 Internal Temperature Sensor
    - TI MSP430 Internal Voltage Sensor

  On Standard Extension Board:
    - Temperature Sensor (LM20 National Semiconductor)
    - Light Sensor (Infineon BPW34S-P1602)

Please see the User Manual (http://www.tinynode.com/tinynode) for more details on the sensors.


Oscilloscope channel assignments:
 0: Temperature
 1: Voltage Supply Monitor
 2: Light
 3: InternalTemperature
 4: InternalVoltage

Usage:

  (See below, Known bugs/limitations)
  Make sure you have run make in tinyos-1.x/contrib/shockfish/tools/java. This dir should be before
  the standard tinyos-1.x/tools/java in the CLASSPATH.
  Install one mote with the Oscilloscope application.
  Install a second mote (connected to the PC) with TOSBase.
  Start running SerialForwarder, typically with java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@COM1:tinynode
  Run: java net.tinyos.oscope.oscilloscope.

  If no readings can be seen:
    - check the "scrolling" checkbox
    - click the "zoom out y" button to see values > 1024


Converting sensor readings to SI units:
The ADC conversions are 12-bits. To get the effective voltage V from an ADC reading , you have:

V = (value / 4096) * V_ref
where V_ref  is (at least for the sensors used here) 1.5V.


Channel 0-1-2: Converting external temperature voltage, voltage supply monitor, and  light 
sensor voltage are described in the TinyNode manual.

Channel 3: Converting the internal temperature voltage to degrees is described
in the Moteiv datasheet available from moteiv.com.

Channel 4: 
To convert the raw value to its corresponding voltage, you do:
(1)  value/4096 * Vref
where Vref = 1.5V

The internal voltage sensor monitors Vcc/2, so multiply
the resulting voltage value by 2 to get mote's supply voltage (Vcc).



Tools:

tinyos-1.x/tools/java/net/tinyos/oscope/oscilloscope

Run the SerialForwarder, then run:
java net.tinyos.oscope.oscilloscope

Known bugs/limitations:
If avr-gcc is not installed on your system, mig will not generate your message classes.
If you do not want to install avr-gcc, download this patch
http://www.shockfish.com/tinynode/patches/tinynode-mig.patch
and apply it from the top level directory of your TinyOS checkout.
Then, recompile the Java Toolchain.  

cd ${TOSROOT}/..
wget http://www.shockfish.com/tinynode/patches/tinynode-mig.patch
patch -p0 < tinynode-mig.patch
cd tinyos-1.x/tools/java/
make
