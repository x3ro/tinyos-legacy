Simple smoketest, checks basic RX/TX functionality.

The commands below should be run from the PingPong directory.



1. Program a node (that is known to be working) by entering:

mkslave hostname

[ where hostname is a machine running gdbproxy, on which the working node is attached ]


2. Once the above command has programmed the working node, enter 'continue' at the 
msp-gdb prompt to start it. This node is the 'slave', ie it simply pongs every ping 
it receives from the master.
After this step, the slave node does not normally need to be started/stopped/reprogrammed anymore.

3. Launch the test node by entering

./smoketest/mktestmaster hostname

[ where hostname is a machine running gdbproxy, on which the test node is attached ]

This command will program the test node, start it, and if everything goes ok it will exit with a "ok" message.


4. Repeat step 3 with a new test node.
