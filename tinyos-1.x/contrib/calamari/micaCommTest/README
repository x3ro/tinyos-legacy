This directory hold a test app that tests both the UART and the I2C
communication between the atmega8 on the ultrasound board and the
atmega128 on the mica.  This app should be programmed onto the
mica2dot.  Change the destination address between TOS_UART_ADDRESS and
0xFF01 to send to either the UART or I2C.  make sure the mica is
programmed with address 0x01 and the ultrasound board is programmed
with address 0xFF01.

Whenever a message is received on the mica2dot from the ultrasound
board, the red led toggles. Beware that when the led toggles on the
mica, it indicates that whatever the atmega8 board is programmed with
is actually being received, and vice versa
