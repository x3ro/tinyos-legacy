This application can be programmed onto a set of telos nodes and will collect RSSI and LQI readings from them all.
To use, open a serial forwarder to the network and run the CollectRssi.py script as follows:

   CollectRssi.py telosb sf@localhost:9001

Make sure that you change the nodeIDs and any other constants that you want to change inside the script itself.
