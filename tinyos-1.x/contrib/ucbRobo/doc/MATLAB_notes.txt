These notes are meant to supplement those in the 
tinyos-1.x/tools/matlab directory.
More info specific to ucbRobo can be found in
tinyos-1.x/contrib/ucbRobo/tools/matlab/README.matlab

- Getting MATLAB R13 License Server to recognize startup.m
  * put startup.m in ~/matlab (~ is your home directory)

- Getting MATLAB R13 License Server to recognize local classpath.txt
  (not using the server copy of classpath.txt)
  * Start up matlab from the directory containing your local classpath.txt

- As of Thu Oct 14 17:15:30 PDT 2004, stopReceiving.m in 
  tinyos-1.x/tools/matlab is still broken (check for misspelling of varargin
  as varagin)
  * Use the one in ucbRobo/doc/fixes until it is fixed.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If you get errors of the sort
  function printMagReportMsg_MagLocalAggRpt does not take type 'double'
  Make sure that printMagReportMsg_MagLocalAggRpt.m is actually define!
  (in this case, we were suppose to use printMagReportMsg_MagDirectBot)
