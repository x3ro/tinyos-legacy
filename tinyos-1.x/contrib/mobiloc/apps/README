Mobiloc:
This is the main application for the mobiloc algorithm.  This application
uses the ultrasound and magnetometer components to estimate range and
bearing to a moving target.  Using this information, location in a global
coordinate frame is estimated and forwarded to the base station (and any
other sensors that are intersted).

TimeSync:
This is an application used to test the Time Synchronization component
of Mobiloc.  The green LED should all blink simultaneously.

MagSensor:
This is an application used to test the magnetometer bearing information.
It sends information back to the base station for testing and debugging
purposes.

UltrasoundSensor:
This application tests the ultrasound receiving capabilities.  It will
send range information back to a base station for testing and debugging.

UltrasoundTransmitter:
This application sends out ranging chirps (radio msg + ultrasound beep) and
is used both for testing purposes with the ultrasound sensor and will
serve as the transmitter on the mobile object driving through the network.
