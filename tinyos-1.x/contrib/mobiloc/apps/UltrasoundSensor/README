This application tests the ultrasound receiving capabilities.  It will
send range information back to a base station for testing and debugging.

The Ultrasound board must be programmed separately using the code in
tinyos-1.x/contrib/calamari/apps/ultrasoundBoardApp
make atmega8 install.0x7e

Code for the mica2dot to talk to the ultrasound board is in
tinyos-1.x/contrib/calamari/apps/micaUltrasoundLib
Code running on the ultrasound board is in
tinyos-1.x/contrib/calamari/apps/omnisound
