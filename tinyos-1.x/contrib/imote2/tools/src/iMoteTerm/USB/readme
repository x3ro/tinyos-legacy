The rev1 subdirectory contains the source code for the iMoteTerm USB edition
application and the project files required for building the application under
Microsoft Visual Studio 2003.net. If a later version of VS is required, the
project files should be importable(this has been tested only once).

Features:
-Ability to talk to either 1 UART or any number of USB-based iMote2's
-Ability to save the raw data and raw sampleRecords that are produced by
 the TestSensorboard application.  The src/Matlab directory contains
 scripts that allow these files to be imported into Matlab.
