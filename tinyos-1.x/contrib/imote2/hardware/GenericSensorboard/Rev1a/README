Notes
-----
This directory contains all of the information created for the iMote2 
GenericSensorboard, including manufacturing info and copies of the CAD 
files used to create the board.  The files included represent the final version
of the board.  They include the physical fix for the upside-down crystal
footprint found on the original version of the board.  The BOM and schematics
also represent the parts placed on the final version of the board.  Please note
that the information included in this directory have has actually been used
to manufacturer a real board.  They are, however, only a small variant from the
original files that were used to make the original boards with the addition/correction
of some known issues.
