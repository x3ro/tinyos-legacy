	 * The offset parameter is the offset of the time stamp field
	 * in the TOS_Msg.data payload. It must be a value between 0 and 25,
	 * although implementations can require a smaller range (e.g. [2,25]).
	 * It is advisable to put the time stamp field at the end of the message.
	 * The local time will be ADDED to this time stamp field in the message
	 * at the time of transmission. Therefore, if the time stamp field
	 * is initialized to 0 when SendMsg.send() is invoked, the receiver
	 * will receive the local time of the sender when it actually sent the
	 * message. On the other hand, if the time stamp field in the message
	 * is initialized with the negative of the local time of some event,
	 * then the receiver will receive the elapsed time since that event.
	 * @return SUCCESS if the offset is in the valid range, or FALSE
	 *	if the message will not be time stamped.
