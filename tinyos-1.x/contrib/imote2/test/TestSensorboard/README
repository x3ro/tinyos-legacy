    in contrib/imote/tos/sensorboards.  As of this writing, 2 boards exist:  GenericSensorboard and BasicSensorboard.
2.) Compile this application by running "make imote2 {debug} SENSORBOARD=<name of the board you want to test>.
    ex:  make imote2 debug SENSORBOARD=GenericSensorboard will compile this app to test the GenericSensorboard
    Note:  if you do not properly specify SENSORBOARD, the application will not compile.
