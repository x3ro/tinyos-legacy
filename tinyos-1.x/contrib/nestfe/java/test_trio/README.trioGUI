-----------------------------------------------------------

This java application is used to interact with a sensor node running
a Trio sensor board test application. 

This program can send a command to different sensor board modules.
To switch between different sensor board modules, a user can select
one of the following items at 'Select Operations' combo box:

  - Leds
  - IO Switch 1 (Low-level component)
  - IO Switch 2 (Low-level component)
  - X1226       (Low-level component)
  - PW Switch   (Low-level component)
  - PIR
  - Magnetometer
  - Microphone
  - Sounder
  - Grenade Timer

A sensor node that receives a command from this program only responds
when it implements that command. For example, TestMag only responds
to Leds commands and Magnetometer commands.

To run this application:

  Go to directory: tinyos-1.x/contrib/nestfe/java
  Run: java java/test_trio/Injecter [optional Group number]
