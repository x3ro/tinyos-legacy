- Currently, there are two versions of the UVA PIR filtering and detection code.
  * nestfe/lib/PIRDetect/PIRDetectC.nc
  * nestfe/lib/detectionevent/EventGenerator/PirDetectEvent/PIRDetectFilterC.nc

- We may want to merge the two versions in the future, probably using
  PIRDetectFilterC as the basis.

- Important differences in PIRDetect and PIRDetectFilter
  * The default sample period has been removed in PIRDetectFilter... it
    waits for it to be set over the network.
  * PIRDetectFilter uses PIRRawDriver, which actually communicates with the
    filter through the registry while PIRDetect manages the PIR sensor
    itself.
    ~ The strip_registry.pl script currently in TestPIRDetectNoReg
      does not accomodate this properly. 
  * The names are different (PIRDetectM vs PIRDetectFilterM) and the
    debug messages have been changed accordingly and also are
    different
    ~ the simulation scripts (ex. simPIRDetect.py) for PIRDetectM will
      not work recognize debug messages properly from PIRDetectFilterM
  * PIRDetectFilter naturally does not set PirRawValue in task filtering()
    if it did, we would have an infinite loop and the mote would no longer respond
