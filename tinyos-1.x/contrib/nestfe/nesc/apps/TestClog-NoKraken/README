TestClog README

This is the basic test app for the routing subsystems.

All nodes send a message to the Drain group every 4 seconds. This
should be configurable by changing the TestClogM.sendPeriod RAM
attribute.

Setting the TestClogIsMobile Nucleus attribute to 1 will make a node
join a Drain group so that it can receive messages over DripSend. 

Forwarders blink green, Receivers blink blue.

There are RAM symbols keeping counts in DripSendM and TestClogM. 

This doesn't include the actual Clog nesC component anymore. It
depends on the Clog daemon running on a base station.
