TestClog README

OK, this is the basic test app for the routing subsystems.

It's designed to require no human interaction, but as such, is only a
bare functionality test and not a performance test.

Node 1 becomes the Clog (landmark)

Node 2 becomes the Tracker (mobile node) by joining the Drain
multicast group and listening to the DripSend.Receive interface.

Node 3 becomes a regular Drain tree root.

The Clog and the Root rebuild their tree every 32 seconds. 

The Tracker rejoins the Drain group every 4 seconds.

The Rest send a message every 4 seconds, alternating between the Clog
tree and the regular Drain tree. They blink Red when they do so.

The Clog and the Root toggle Blue when they get a message over the
Drain tree.

The Tracker toggles Green when it gets a message over DripSend.Receive.

If some friendly tester would like to modify this in order to gather
performance statistics, it would be much appreciated. Some judicious
use of Nucleus Attributes may make this much easier. Though, I haven't
actually done this yet myself, and am pretty sure that Nucleus needs
some modification in order to select the appropriate tree (Clog
vs. Root).

I'll be improving this app as time goes on.
