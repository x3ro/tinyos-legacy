README for Chirp running over T-MAC without modification
Author/Contact: T.E.V.Parker@ewi.tudelft.nl

Description:

The original app was used by S-MAC as a test (this readme is adapted from the
readme by Wei Ye <weiye@isi.edu>) and is now used as a T-MAC test.

The application is copied from tinyos-1.x/apps/Chirp/ to demonstrate the
compatibility provided by T-MAC stack that allows applications developed on 
standard UCB's stack (based on GenericComm and AMStandard) to run over
T-MAC with out any modifications.

T-MAC debugging code (enable with -DTMAC_DEBUG) has been added, but nothing else.

Makefile is modified to include correct search paths.

The following is the original README for Chirp application
