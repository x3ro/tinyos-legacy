README for Chirp running over T-MAC
Author/Contact: T.E.V.Parker@ewi.tudelft.nl

Description:

The original app was used by S-MAC as a test (this readme is adapted from the
readme by Wei Ye <weiye@isi.edu>) and is now used as a T-MAC test. This version of
Chirp has been adapted to use unicast rather than broadcast messages. The Makefile
should be altered to contain the number of nodes that you wish to use. Nodes should be 
numbered from 0 to MAX_NODES-1. Each node except 0 sends to the node with an id one less
than it's own, and 0 sends to MAX_NODES-1.

The application is copied from tinyos-1.x/apps/Chirp/ to demonstrate the
compatibility provided by T-MAC stack that allows applications developed on 
standard UCB's stack (based on GenericComm and AMStandard) to run over
T-MAC with out any modifications.

T-MAC debugging code (enable with -DTMAC_DEBUG) has also been added.

Makefile is modified to include correct search paths.

The following is the original README for the Chirp application
