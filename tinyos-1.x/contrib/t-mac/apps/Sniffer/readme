Sniffer readme
==============
Install the sniffer program (make tnode install), and then run
../parse.py <your serial port>. You should see lots of RADIO_TEST_RECV
messages. Look at the two data items after that. 255 255 is start of message,
then the next byte is the length of the packet, followed by a type byte.
Types:
	6 = DATA
	7 = RTS
	8 = CTS
	9 = ACK
	10 = SYNC

The file tos/system/TMACMsg.h has details of the rest of the packet formats.
Note that a data packet currently consists of a MACHeader followed by a TOS_Pkt
but this will be better compressed in the future.
