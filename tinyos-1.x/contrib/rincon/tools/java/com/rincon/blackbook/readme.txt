From the com.rincon.blackbook directory, you can run the following
applications with the mote as long as apps\Blackbook3\demos\BlackbookConnect 
is installed on the mote:

com.rincon.blackbook.BlackbookConnect - gives you direct access to the
    Blackbook interface from your computer.  See the readme in the
    nesC BlackbookConnect directory.
    
com.rincon.blackbook.memorystick.MemoryStick - lets you control files
    by uploading/downloading/deleting on the mote from your computer.
    See the readme in the nesC BlackbookConnect directory.
    
com.rincon.blackbook.printstatus.PrintFile -
com.rincon.blackbook.printstatus.PrintNode -
com.rincon.blackbook.printstatus.PrintSector -
    All three of these applications help in debugging Blackbook and show
    you the status of files, nodes, and sectors through BlackbookConnect
    on the mote.
    

See the readme file in that directory for more information.
