A lot of these mote applications require the State and Transceiver components.

You can find these components in /contrib/rincon/tos/lib.  Download them.

And you can read about them there too.  They should be totally compatible with whatever
you're running right now.

Just download them, put them in your lib directory or wherever, and make sure
the applications' Makefiles point to the correct locations of the Transceiver and State
components.  All the applications here should compile if you just download
the entire rincon directory.
