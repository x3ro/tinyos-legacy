This module contains code for IFRC (Interference-Aware Fair
Rate Control). IFRC is a rate control/congestion control
scheme for wireless sensor network to assign fair and
efficient rate to all the flows in the network (assuming a
many-to-one traffic pattern). For further details please
refer to http://enl.usc.edu/~srangwal/projects/ifrc.html

To compile the code (to see how IFRC module can be used)
(i)  cd to apps/RateControl 
(ii) set IFRCROOT to the directory containing the checkout code.
     Your TOSDIR should point to the default tinyos tree you are
     currently using. 
(iii) Set other parametes (like base station id etc) in the
Makefile and do a make tmote 

Currently the code is supported for Tmote Sky. 

For any further information please contact Sumit Rangwala at
