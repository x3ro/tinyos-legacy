README for CotsBots Platform
Author/Contact: cotsbots-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

As I am only one person, and not a very computer science-oriented one at that,
I am counting on the users of the CotsBots robots to help debug and expand
the current interfaces and components.

If you run into any problems, please email the above address.  It doesn't
matter how small they may seem to you -- if nothing else, it will help
me clarify the included documentation.  If you have any suggestions, please
email those as well.

In addition, I will refer you to the ReadThisFirst.htm file in the 
contrib/cotsbots/doc directory for some changes since the CotsBots were 
handed out at the January 2003 PI Meeting.

Have fun!
