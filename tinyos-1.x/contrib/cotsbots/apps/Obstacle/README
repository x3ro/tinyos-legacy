README for Obstacle

Description:

This is an obstacle-avoidance program that utilizes the accelerometer on
the mica sensorboard to determine the presence of an obstacle.  When
an obstacle is detected, the robot will back up, turn, and go in a
new direction.

Tools:

No tools are required for this application.

Known bugs/limitations:

Depending on the surface this is running on and the speed at which this is 
running, the thresholds on the obstacle component may need to be adjusted.
Some more filtering could be used to reduce the number of false positives.
In addition, if the car is coming into a wall at a relatively shallow angle 
the obstacle avoidance may not trigger.
