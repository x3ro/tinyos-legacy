README for Tools Directory
Author/Contact: cotsbots-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to successfully make the java files in this
directory, add the following to your classpath:
$TINYOS/contrib/cotsbots/tools
where $TINYOS is your main tinyos-1.x diretory.

This directory currently includes two applications: RobotCmdGUI (used
as an interface to the robots -- remote control or debugging/packet injection)
and BeepDiffusion (used to inject packets for the BeepDiffusion application).

RobotCmdGUI:

This application requires the SerialForwarder to run, so it must already
be running.  Make sure that you set the appropriate bit rate for
mica/mica2 while openening SerialForwarder.

usage: java RobotCmd/RobotCmdGUI [group_id]

A window should appear that gives various slider bar/button interfaces
to drive the robot, calibrate it, test/debug, etc.  This application
also includes a section for sending Navigation packets for the 
TestNavigation application.

BeepDiffusion:

This is based on BcastInject and the syntax is similar.

usage: java RobotCmd/BeepDiffusion <command> [arguments[
	where <command> and [arguments] are
	1) tick_length (ms)
	2) go

This application is used to inject packets to start the BeepDiffusion
application.  The StartDiffusion mote may also be used for this purpose
(code in apps/BeepDiffusion).
