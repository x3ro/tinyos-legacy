This tool is made for collecting large amounts of data from a single node at a time.
This implementation is a rewrite of the concept from contrib/nestfe/nesc/lib/Straw, 
except that it uses Python tools instead of java tools.

The tool for this library can be found in tinyos-1.x/contrib/ucb/tools/python/pytos/tools
