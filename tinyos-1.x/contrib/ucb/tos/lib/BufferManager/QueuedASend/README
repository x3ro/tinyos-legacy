README for QueuedASend 
Author/Contact: hohltb@cs.berkeley.edu 

Description:
QueuedASend is a TinyOS fowarding queue component that supports 
Buffer Management as well as multiple scheduling policies. The 
default scheduling policy is store-and-forward. 

To write your own policy create your own component that uses the 
interface QueuePolicy. See templates for an example.

SendQueue is the forwarding queue created from a CircleQueue FIFOQueue template.
It allocates the queue space and implements the List interface. The SendQueue
is shared by both FreeAList and SwapList of the BufferPool.

ASendM provides the buffer management. It implements the interfaces AllocASend 
and SendMsg. AllocASend allocates free buffers for the applicaiton component.
ASendM places messages from both the routing and application components on the 
SendQueue and returns the buffers to their respective free lists after 
the messages have been sent.
