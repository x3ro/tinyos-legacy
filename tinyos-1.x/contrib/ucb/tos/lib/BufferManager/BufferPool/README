README for BufferPool 
Author/Contact: hohltb@cs.berkeley.edu 

Description:
This is a global buffer cache for TinyOS. It is partitioned into
multiple free lists. The size of each free list is configurable and 
set at compile time in the respective module file.

Each free list is reserved for use by a TinyOS specific component.
SwapList - a free list of buffers reserved for the routing component
FreeAlist - a free list of buffers reserved for the QueuedASend component
		for application layer buffer allocation.

To add additional free lists, simply create a new FreeList component
using the example in the CircleQueue/templates directory and place it
in the BufferPool directory.
