Author/Contact: hohltb@cs.berkeley.edu 

Description:

TestRandomMLCG is a simple application that tests the RandomMLCG
pseudorandom number generator.

The first seed is TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS + 1. To test for correctness, if the 
first seed = 1, then seed 10001 = 1043618065. This has been tested on
mica2, mica2dot, and pc platforms.
