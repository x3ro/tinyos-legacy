README for DotID
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

DotID takes a mote's ID and writes it to a predefined location in
non-volatile storage. This ID can then later be loaded at boot to
maintain a consistent mote ID over multiple program installations; the
mote ID does not have to be hardcoded into each program image. The ID
installed is the one hardcoded into the DotID image.

DotID turns the red LED on when the ID is written to EEPROM, then
turns the yellow LED on when the ID is read out of the EEPROM. The
read ID is then sent in an AM broadcast message of type 16. When this
message send is completed, DotID turns the green LED on.

Tools:

None.

Known bugs/limitations:

Mote programs do not load the mote ID from EEPROM by default.  DotID
does not currently use the ByteEEPROM component to allocate its EEPROM
region.
