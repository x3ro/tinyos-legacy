This code allows you to collect RSSI readings from a number of nodes in a batch fashion.

Install the code on a number of dot3 or mica2 nodes with increasing node numbers, e.g. 1-16.

Then, make sure you have a generic base on your serial port.  you will probably have to use the "-baud 57600" option with your serialForward program.

Finally, run the tools/matlab/contrib/kamin/chipconRSSI.m matlab application as described in the README there.  

Instead of collecting your own data, you could just use the data and analysis also in that contrib/kamin directory.
