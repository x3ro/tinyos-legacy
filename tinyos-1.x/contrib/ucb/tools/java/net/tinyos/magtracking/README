package net.tinyos.magtracking.*

README:

The tools in this directory allow you to interact with motes running the code found in: "minitasks/02/ucb/magtracking_demo", which you can checkout from sourceforge similarly to the tinyos-1.x directory

To create the tools in this java package, type make twice (2X).  The makefile uses MIG to generate message classes that interact with the code in tinyos1.x/lib/Ranging.  MIG (message interface generator) usually goes into the NesC code found in those directories to figure out the structure of the packets they are generating/expecting and then generates Java message objects with a matching structure.  However, because magtracking uses a dynamic message structure, MIG doesn't quite work.  As a workaround, I defined the actual packets used in magtracking in the ./Packets.h file, which MIG is directed to.  Make sure you change this file if the magtracking application changes

There are many ways to use the message objects created by MIG.  One such way is found in the tinyos1.x/doc/tutorial/matlab.html tutorial.

To use the ranging message objects from Matlab:
1) open matlab
2) change to your /tinyos1.x/tools/matlab/contrib/magtracking directory
3) run 'defineMagtrackingEnvironment' to setup matlab to use these tools
