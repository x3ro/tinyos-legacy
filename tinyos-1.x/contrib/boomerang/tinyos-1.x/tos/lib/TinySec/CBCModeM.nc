/**
 * Implements CBC Mode using Cipher Text Stealing (CBC-CTS) as described in
 * Schneir's Applied Cryptography (195-6) and RFC-2040.
 * <br>
 * Plain CBC mode is pretty simple; using CTS complicates things. CTS allows
 * the ciphertext to be the same size as the plaintext, even for plaintexts
 * which aren't a multiple of the block size.
 *
 *        C_0     == E[IV]
 *        C_i     == E[ C_{i-1} ^ P_i ]                   0 < i < n-2
 *        C_{n-1} == E[ C_{n-2} ^ P_{n-1} ]
 *                == E[ C_{n-2} ^ (P_{n-1} || 0/-L) ]
 *                == C_{n-1}/+L || C_{n-1}/-L    (naming of ciphertext block
 *                                                into left and right pieces)
 *        C_n     == E[ C_{n-1}/+L ^ P_n || C_{n-1}/-L ]
 *
 *  Where 0 = the zero block
 *        n = number of blocks. the last block may be length 1..blockSize bytes
 *        L = |P_n|, the length of the last block and
 *        /+L refers to the first L bytes of a block and
 *        /-L refers to the last (blockSize - L) bytes of a block
 *
 * We then output C_0 || ... || C_{n-2} || C_n || C_{n-1}/+L so that the
 * ciphertext is the same size as the input.
