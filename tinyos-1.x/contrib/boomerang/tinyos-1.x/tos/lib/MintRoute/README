Important parameters to tune in MultihopWMEWMA.nc

    BASE_STATION_ADDRESS        = 0,
    ROUTE_TABLE_SIZE            = 16,
    ESTIMATE_TO_ROUTE_RATIO     = 10,
    DATA_TO_ROUTE_RATIO         = 2,
    DATA_FREQ                   = 10000,
    SWITCH_THRESHOLD     	= 192,
    MAX_DESCENDANT		= 5

In this protocol, the minimum message rate is defined by route message
rate, which is a ratio of the data rate defined by
DATA_TO_ROUTE_RATIO.  For example, if DATA_FREQ is 10000 (~ 1
packet/10 sec) and DATA_TO_ROUTE_RATIO is 2, the route message
is will be 20000 (~ 1 msg/20sec).  This rate is tunable and
will affect network load and rate of adaptation to changes.

ESTIMATE_TO_ROUTE is a parameter that defines the time window
T for WMEWMA estimator.  If it is set to 10, it means that
an estimation will be performed every ten route message time.

SWITCH_THRESHOLD is a parameter to define a noise margin for
switching to a better parent.  It is a scaled value. To convert
it to the number of transmission, simply divide it by 256.  
In this case, 192/256 = 0.75.  That is, we only switch to a 
new parent if its cost is 0.75 lower than our current parent.

MAX_DESCENDADNT_LIVE is used as a paremter to time out children
in the neighbor table. 5 means a child 

Notice that chooseParent() is called on a periodic basis as
a route damping mechanism.  The period is the same as the
route message rate.  

The current route table managment is a simple filtering
mechanism based on send (outbound) link estimations.
