To configure motlle for use, run 'make' in this directory.

To build a VM, for instance the example VM in the examples directory:
  cd examples # you must be in the examples directory to build the VM
  motlle-vmbuild base.vmsf # builds the VM
This will create $TOSDIR/apps/MotlleVM.

You then need to compile and install this VM, e.g.:
  cd /opt/tinyos-1.x/apps/MotlleVM
  make mica2 install.0

You install applications using the tools/mload script, which requires
that you have a SerialForwarder running to talk to a mote. You must be in the
generated VM's directory when you run mload (more specifically, the conf.mt
file which you find there needs to be in the current directory).
Using the previously built VM:
  cd /opt/tinyos-1.x/apps/MotlleVM
  motlle-load /opt/tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/VM/languages/motlle/examples/cnttoleds.mt

Your leds should start blinking.
