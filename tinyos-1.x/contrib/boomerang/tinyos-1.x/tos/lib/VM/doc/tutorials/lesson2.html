		  This lesson introduces the TinyScript
		  language. Using the VM from Lesson 1, you write a
		  series of increasingly complex programs, culminating
		  in one that sends a temperature reading when
		  filtered light readings go over a threshold.

		<TD>
		  <p>In Lesson 1, you installed a few scripts on
		  Bombilla motes. The scripts were in TinyScript,
		  which is a simple BASIC-like language. TinyScript is
		  imperative and dynamically typed. Every VM has a set
		  of events that it handles. Each event has a handler,
		  a piece of code that runs when that event
		  occurs. TinyScript has basic control structures,
		  such as loops and conditionals. Part of customizing
		  a VM is to include functions to support the sets of
		  operations an application needs.</p>

		  <p>A TinyScript program two parts: variable
		  declarations and statements. All variables that a
		  program uses must be declared before any
		  statements. For example, this is CntToLeds from
		  Lesson 1:</p>
		  
		  <TABLE>
		    <TR>
		      <TD>Variable Declarations</TD>

			<PRE>counter = counter +1;
led(counter % 8);</PRE>
		      </TD>
		    </TR>
		  </TABLE>

		  <p>TinyScript has three kinds of variables: private,
		  shared, and buffer. <b>Private</b> variables are
		  local to a handler; only the handler that declares
		  the variable can access it. For example, if two
		  handlers both have a private variable named
		  <tt>counter</tt>, each one has its own, independent
		  variable.</p>

		  <p>In constrast, <b>shared</b> variables are not
		  unique to handlers: this allows two handlers to
		  share data. If two handlers both have a shared
		  variable named <tt>counter</tt>, it is a single
		  variable that they share. If one handler increments
		  it, the other handler will see the change.</p>

		  <p>Shared and private variables are dynamically
		  typed. TinyScript has two basic types: integers and
		  sensor readings. Sensor readings are further divided
		  into all of the types of sensors (a magnetometer
		  reading is distinct from a light
		  reading). "Dynamically typed" means that a program
		  dynamically determines the type of a variable as it
		  runs, rather than than a compiler or programmer
		  stating it at compile-time. For example:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
private val;

val = 1;        ! val is an integer
val = light();  ! val is now a light reading
val = magX();   ! val is now a magnetometer reading (x-axis)
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Dynamic typing means that a variable can have "no
		  type." A variable with no type acts as the identity
		  (e.g., zero). For example, in the following program
		  the variable <tt>counter</tt> has never been used
		  before:</p>
	
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
private counter;        ! no type: never been used before; first execution
counter = counter + 1;  ! counter takes type integer, with value 1
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Types limit what operations on a variable are
		  valid. Sensor readings are immutable. You cannot add
		  an integer to a light reading, a light reading to a
		  temperature reading, or even two light readings. If
		  you want to process sensorn readings, you must turn
		  them into integers with the <tt>int()</tt> function.
		  For example:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
private total;
private count;
private val;

val = light();            ! legal: val is now a light reading
val = light() / 2;        ! error: cannot divide light reading by 2
val = light() + magX();   ! error: cannot add light and magX
val = light() + light();  ! error: cannot add two light readings

val = int(light());       ! legal: val is now an integer
total = total + val;      ! legal: total was an int
count = count + 1;        ! legal: count was an int
val = total/count;        ! legal: average of readings

		    </pre>
		  </quote>
		  
		  <p>Finally, <b>buffer</b> variables are vectors of a
		  fixed maximum size, and are always shared. Just like
		  private and shared scalars, buffers are typed; a
		  buffer can only contain values of a single type. A
		  buffer's contents and type can be cleared with the
		  <tt>bclear()</tt> function. If a buffer has no type,
		  it takes the type of the first value put into
		  it.</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer bufOne;
buffer bufTwo;

bclear(bufOne);         ! clear bufferOne 
bufOne[0] = 5;          ! Put 5 in index 0: bufOne has size one, type integer
bufOne[] = id();        ! Append mote ID to bufOne, now has size two
bufOne[4] = 41;         ! Put 41 in index 4; bufOne has size five,
                        ! buf[2] and buf[3] are zero
bufOne[5] = light();    ! error: buffer is type integer, not light
bufOne[5] = int(light); ! legal: integer

bufTwo = bufOne;        ! make bufTwo a copy of bufOne

		  <p>To sample sensor readings, your mote must have a
		  sensor board. By default, Bombilla compiles for the
		  standard mica sensor board (micasb), and provides
		  sensors for light and temperature. If you have that
		  sensor board, it should work fine. If you are using
		  a different sensor board -- the mica weather board
		  (micawb), for example -- then you may need to <A
		  HREF="#sboard">rebuild and recompile
		  Bombilla</A>.</p>
		  
		  <p>As CntToLeds in Lesson 1 showed, periodic
		  programs in Mat&eacute; usually have two scripts:
		  the first is what to do periodically, the second
		  starts the periodic execution. Instead of displaying
		  a counter, as in CntToLeds, the following timer
		  script samples the light sensor (or other sensor, if
		  you have a board besides micasb).</p>

		  <p>Open the "timer0.txt" file you wrote in lesson
		  one, and modify it to be</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
private reading;

reading = light();
led(reading / 128);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>This displays the top three bits of the sensor
		  reading. Inject this with Scripter as before:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm tossim-serial timer0 timer0.txt
		    </pre>
		  </quote>


		  <p>If Timer0 is already running (e.g., you kept your
		  mote on from last lesson), then this script will
		  start executing immediately. If you need to start
		  Timer0, inject "once.txt" from the previous lesson,
		  which calls settimer0().</p>

		  <p>You should see this error message appear at the
		  console:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
Error received:
  Context:     TIMER0
  Cause:       TYPE_CHECK
  Capsule:     TIMER0
  Instruction: 5

		  </quote> 

		  <p>The led() function takes a value, but light()
		  returns a light reading: when Mat&eacute; tried to
		  execute led() the parameter failed a type
		  check. When the VM encounters a run-time error, it
		  halts execution of all contexts, flashes the LEDs,
		  and periodically broadcasts an error message to the
		  radio and UART: the Scripter tool read it from the
		  UART and displayed the error. Installing new code
		  clears the VM from the error state (it
		  reboots). Change "timer0.txt" to be: </p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
private reading;

reading = int(light());
led(reading / 128);

		<TD>

		  <P>All of the scripts so far have been for the Once
		  or Timer0 events, and only used a small number of
		  functions. The Bombilla VM has a wider range of
		  event handlers that you can use. To see the full set
		  of options, run Scripter with the <tt>-gui</tt>
		  option:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -gui 
		    </pre>
		  </quote>		  

		  <p>You should see a window similar to this:</p>

		  <CENTER>
		    <IMG SRC="fig/gui.gif">
		  </CENTER>

		  <p>The Scripter GUI has three major parts. The left
		  panel has a selection for which event handler you
		  which to program. The Bombilla VM has six event
		  handlers. They are:</p>

		  <ul>
		    <li><b>Broadcast:</b> Runs when the
		    mote receives a packet broadcast by another mote
		    with the <tt>bcast()</tt> function.</li>

		    <li><b>Once:</b> Runs once, when it installs. You
		    used this event to start Timer0 in earlier parts
		    of the tutorial.</li>

		    <li><b>Reboot:</b> Runs after the VM reboots
		    (every time new code for any handler
		    arrives).</li>

		    <li><b>Timer0:</b> Runs when timer0 fires. The
		    function <tt>settimer0()</tt> sets the firing
		    rate.</li>

		    <li><b>Timer1:</b> Runs when timer1 fires. The
		    function <tt>settimer1()</tt> sets the firing
		    rate.</li>

		    <li><b>Trigger:</b> Runs when another handler
		    calls the <tt>trigger()</tt> function.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>Below the handler selection is a list of all
		  current shared variables and buffers, and below that
		  is a button for injecting code.</p>

		  <p>The center panel is where you write program
		  text. The GUI currently limits programs to 99 lines.
		  The right panel displays the set of functions a VM
		  provides. Below the list is a text area that
		  displays a brief description of a function. So far,
		  you've used the <tt>light</tt>, <tt>id</tt>,
		  <tt>settimer0</tt>, and <tt>led</tt> functions.</p>
		  
		  <p>You can load text files into the program text
		  area with the <b>File</b> menu's <b>Load</b>
		  element.</p>

		  <p>Select the Timer0 handler, enter this code in the
		  program window and inject it. It toggles the red
		  mote LED when it runs:</p>

		   <quote>
		    <pre>
led(25);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>	

		  <p>Select the Timer0 handler, enter this code into
		  the program window and inject it. It toggles the green
		    mote LED when it runs:</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
led(26);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Finally, inject a Once handler that starts the
		  two Timers at different rates:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
settimer0(1);
settimer1(8);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>You should see the red and green LEDs blinking at
		  different frequencies. The description of the
		  <tt>led</tt> function describes how to set, turn on,
		  turn off, and toggle LEDs. When you're done playing
		  with the LEDs, inject a Once handler that stops the
		  timers (calls the settimer functions with zero as a
		  parameter).</p>

		  <p>For the rest of the tutorial, you can either use
		  the Scripter GUI or its command line tool
		  invocation. The parameters to the command line are:</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter <i>&lt;handler name&gt;</i> <i>&lt;file name&gt;</i>
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p><i>Handler name</i> is case-insensitive (Once is
		  the same as once), but <i>file name</i> is
		  case-sensitive.</p>
		    
		  <p>TinyScript has standard language control
		  structures, like loops and conditionals. For
		  example, this program puts light readings into a
		  buffer until it is full, the clears the
		  buffer. <tt>bfull</tt> returns true if a buffer is
		  full, false otherwise. <tt>bsize</tt> returns how
		  many elements are in a buffer. <tt>bclear</tt>
		  clears a buffer, emptying it and making it have no
		  type. Inject it as the Timer0 handler:</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer data;

data[] = light();    ! This appends the reading
if bfull(data) then
  bclear(data);
end if
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Start Timer0 with a Once handler that calls
		  <tt>settimer0(2)</tt> (5 Hz). Another way to fill
		  the buffer (by directly indexing):</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer data;

data[bsize(data)] = light();    ! This puts the reading at the first free element
if bfull(data) then
  bclear(data);
end if
		    </pre>
		  </quote>	  

		  <p>To make sure the program is doing what you think
		  it is, include an LED indicator of whether it's
		  cleared the buffer:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer data;

data[] = light();    
if bfull(data) then
  bclear(data);
  led(2);                       ! Turn on LED 1
else
  led(1);                       ! Turn on LED 2
end if
		    </pre>
		  </quote>	  

		  <p>You should see the geen LED on, but every two
		  seconds it will briefly turn off and the red will
		  turn on.</p>
		  
		  <p>This next script is a little more complex: when
		  the buffer is full, it uses a loop to pull the
		  highest value out of the buffer and display its top
		  three bits on the LEDs</p>:

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer data;
private i;
private size;
private max;
private val;

data[] = light();    

if bfull(data) then
  size = bsize(data);
  max = 0;

  for i=0 until i >= size              ! Scan through values
    val = int(data[i]);        
    if (val > max) then 
      max = val;               ! Find the max
    end if
  next i

  led(max / 128);              ! Display max on LEDs
  bclear(data);
else
  led(0);               ! Turn off the LEDs
end if
		    </pre>
		  </quote>	  

		  <p>There are two basic kinds of loops in TinyScript
		  (as in BASIC): unconditional and conditional. The
		  above loop is conditional: is loops until the
		  condition <tt>i &gt;= size</tt> is true. Loops can
		  also be unconditional, where they loop for a finite
		  number of steps. These loops take the form</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
for i=0 to x
...
next i
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Where <i>x</i> is a constant (it cannot be a
		  variable). If you want to increment until a
		  variable, then you should use a conditional loop as
		  the above handler does.</p>

		  <p>By default the initialized variable (<i>i</i> in
		  the above example) increments by one on each
		  execution. You can change this with the
		  <tt>step</tt> qualifier. For example, this loops
		  <i>counter</i> from 0 to 100 in increments of
		  ten:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
for counter=0 to 100 step 10
...
next counter
		    </pre>
		  </quote>
		  
		  
		  <p>The above filtering handler is relatively long
		  and cumbersome: it compiles to fifty-one
		  bytes. Bombilla provides functions to support this
		  sort of processing. The functions <tt>bsorta</tt>
		  and <tt>bsortd</tt> sort the elements of a buffer in
		  ascending and descending order respectively. An
		  simpler version of the above program is:</p>

		  


		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer data;
private val;

data[] = light();    

if bfull(data) then
  bsortd(data);               ! Sort in descending order (highest is first)
  led(int(data[0]) / 128);    ! Display max on LEDs
  bclear(data);
else
  led(0);                     ! Turn off the LEDs

		  <p>So far, all of the programs have been using the

		  <p>The <tt>uart</tt> function sends a TinyOS packet
		  containing a Mat&eacute; data buffer. When you
		  compile a VM, it builds a Java class representing
		  this packet, called <tt>BufferUARTMsg</tt>. The
		  Mat&eacute; toolchain has a tool for reading these
		  packets. It needs to connect to the mote, so if you
		  are using the Scripter GUI (which keeps its
		  connection open), you have to use a SerialForwarder
		  so both the GUI and packet reader can listen to mote
		  packets. That is, if you are using the GUI you
		  should not use <tt>-comm serial</tt>. Start the
		  reader with:</p>

		  <p>VMBufferReader has an optional <tt>-comm</tt>
		  parameter; by default it connects to SerialForwarder
		  on the local machine. If the above script is
		  running, you should soon see output like this:</p>

		  <p>The first number (zero in the above output) is
		    the mote ID; the second is the sensor reading.</p>
		  
		  <p>If you want to build your own GUIs or Java tools
		  on top of Mat&eacute;, you'll probably be dealing
		  with data buffers. The source code of VMBufferReader
		  should be a good place to start on how to do so.</p>

		  Of
		  course transmitting to the UART is only sort-of

		  <p>The Trigger context allows a handler to request
		  an asynchronous operation. When a handler calls the
		  <tt>trigger</tt> function (which takes a buffer as a
		  parameter), it triggers the Trigger handler to run
		  (hence its name). The passed buffer is copied to the
		  Trigger context, so the caller can continue
		  executing. Meanwhile, the Trigger handler will start
		  running in parallel.</p>

		  <p>We can use this behavior to write a program that
		  has two parts. The first is a handler that
		  periodically runs and filters light readings. When
		  the filtered value goes over a threshold, the
		  handler triggers the Trigger handler. The Trigger
		  handler then samples the temperature sensor and
		  sends a packet to the UART with the reading. The
		  periodic handler is essentially a condition ("when
		  filtered light is above x"), and the Trigger handler
		  is the action to take when the condition is
		  two. Putting them in separate handlers allows you to
		  reprogram the two individually.</p>

		  <p>Stop Timer0 and Timer1 by sending a Once handler
		  that calls the <tt>settimer</tt> functions with a
		  period of zero:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
settimer0(0);
settimer1(0);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Next, install the Trigger handler. This program
		  samples the temperature sensor and sends a buffer
		  with the reading to the UART:</p>


		  <quote>
		    <pre>
buffer buf;

bclear(buf);
buf[0] = temp();
led(26);             ! Blink green
uart(buf);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Install a Timer0 handler that filters light
		  readings with an exponentially weighted moving
		  average (EWMA), and when that goes over a threshold
		  calls <tt>trigger()</tt>:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
private average;
buffer empty;

average = average + int(light());
average = average / 2;
led(25);            ! Blink red

if (average > 600) then
  trigger(empty);
end if
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Finally, start Timer0 firing at 5Hz with a Once
		  handler:</p>
		  	 
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
settimer0(2);
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>The mote will blink its red LED on each light
		  sample, and blink the green LED when it sends a
		  temperature reading. If it isn't triggering, then
		  you can lower the threshold in the Timer0 handler
		  from 600; hopefully this should help. Note that in
		  the above program Trigger sends a buffer of type
		  <TT>TEMP</tt> (temperature readings).</p>

		  <p>This concludes Lesson 2. In the next lesson,
		  you'll start using the radio.</p>

		<TD>

		  <p>If you have sensorboards other than the standard
		  mica sensor board (micasb), then you need to rebuild
		  and recompile Bombilla to support your board. This
		  requires modifying the VM specification file. <A
		  HREF="lesson5.html">Lesson 4</A> has details on
		  doing this, but here we'll just change it in a very
		  limited fashion.</p>

		  <p>Mat&eacute; currently supports the mica sensor
		  board (micasb) and the basic sensor board
		  (basicsb). We hope to support additional boards in
		  the future.  <A HREF="lesson5.html">Lesson 5</A>
		  shows how Mat&eacute; can be extended to support
		  additional boards. Making Bombilla use a different
		  sensor board requires changing the VM specification
		  file.</p>

		  <p>Open the Bombilla VM specification file
		  <tt>bombilla.vmsf</tt> in a text editor. It resides
		  in the <tt>samples</tt> subdirectory of
		  <tt>lib/VM</tt> The fifth line of the file says</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;LOAD FILE="../sensorboards/micasb.vmsf"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Depending on what board you want, the line to:</p>
		    
		  <TABLE>
		    <TR>
		      <TD>
			<b>basic sensor board (basicsb):</b>
		      </TD>
		      <TD>
			<tt>&lt;LOAD FILE="../sensorboards/basicsb.vmsf"&gt;</tt>
		      </TD>
		      <TD>
			<b>telos onboard sensors:</b>
		      </TD>
		      <TD>
			<tt>&lt;LOAD FILE="../sensorboards/telos.vmsf"&gt;</tt>
		      </TD>
		    </TR>
		  </TABLE>

		  <p>Basically, change the name of the vmsf file to
		  the sensorboard. This will automatically include
		  functions for all of the sensorboard's sensors. If
		  this means that you have functions for sensors that
		  are not populated on your board (e.g., you do not
		  have a magnetometer on your micasb), don't worry
		  about it. In the long term -- say, you were
		  deploying a Mat&eacute; network -- you may want to
		  not include them, but for the sake of the tutorial
		  it's not an issue.</p>

		  <p>Once you have made this change, rebuild
		  Bombilla. Remember that this <b>must be done from
		  the samples directory</b>:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder -nw bombilla.vmsf</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Then, go to <tt>apps/Bombilla</tt> and recompile
		  the VM for your hardware.</p>


		  <p>These are the sensors the various sensor boards
		  provide:</p>

		  </TABLE>

		  <p>Note that some Telos motes do not have their
		  sensors populated. This causes the
		  <tt>totalsolar</tt> and <tt>photoactive</tt> sensors
		  to return bogus values: they are simple ADC
		  captures. In contrast, the <tt>humidity</tt> and
		  <tt>temperature</tt> functions interact with digital
		  sensors over a bus; if they are not populated, the
		  VM will enter an error state.</p>
