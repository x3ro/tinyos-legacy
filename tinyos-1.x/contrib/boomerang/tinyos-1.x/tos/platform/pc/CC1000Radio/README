This is a port of the CC1000 Radio stack to TOSSIM.  It was done by
taking the mica2 version and taking out all the hardware specific
stuff.  This means that this version does not correctly simulate all
the CSMA timing, etc.  However, it does allow simulation of programs
that use CC1000 specific features, such as changing transmission power.  

TODO: Make the radio model actually change when a mote varies
transmission power.
