How to compile TOSBoot for Tmote Invent:

Copy all contents of this directory to:
tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/Deluge/TOSBoot/

Make sure you overwrite the Makefile in that directory.

Change your working directory to:
tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/Deluge/TOSBoot/

type:
make tmote
(note: NOT telosb)

build/telosb/ will now contain the Tmote Invent booloader.

This will replace the telosb bootloader with the Tmote Invent booloader

If you want to go back to the telosb bootloader, you will need to
return to that directory and type:

make telosb

build/telosb/ will now contain the telosb booloader.
