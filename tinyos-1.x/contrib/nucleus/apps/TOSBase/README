README for TOSBase
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

TOSBase is an application that acts as a simple bridge between the
serial and radio links.

TOSBase will copy its compiled-in group ID to messages moving from the
serial link to the radio, and will filter out incoming radio messages
that do not contain that group ID.

TOSBase includes queues in both directions, with a guarantee that once
a message enters a queue, it will eventually leave on the other
interface.

TOSBase acknowledges a message arriving over the serial link only if
that message was successfully enqueued for delivery to the radio link.

The LEDS are programmed to toggle as follows:

RED Toggle         - Message bridged from serial to radio
GREEN Toggle       - Message bridged from radio to serial
YELLOW/BLUE Toggle - Dropped message due to queue overflow 
                     in either direction
