README for UartRelay
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

UartRelay was copied from GenericBase.  Update description.

Description:

UartRelay is a PC to sensor network bridge. Packets received from a
PC from the UART are sent out on the radio, and packets received from
the radio are sent out on the UART. This allows a PC to monitor
network traffic and inject packets into a network.

By default, GenericBase checks CRCs. Packets sent to it over the UART
must set the CRC field of the packet to 1, or GenericBase will not
successfully receive the packet.

When GenericBase sends a packet to the UART (receives from the radio),
it toggles the green LED. When GenericBase sends a packet to the radio
(receives from the UART), it blinks the red LED.

If a send fails, GenericBase toggles the yellow LED.

GenericBase only receives and sends packets addressed to its AM
group. It receives and sends packets to any mote ID.

Tools:

Many tools use GenericBase as a bridge to send a receive packets from motes.

Known bugs/limitations:

Because the UART layer has no framing protocol, extra bytes over the
UART can cause the packet layer to become unresponsive, as subsequent
packets are at unexpected offsets.
