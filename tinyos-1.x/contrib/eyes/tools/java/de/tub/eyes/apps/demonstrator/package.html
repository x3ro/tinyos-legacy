This is the top-level package for the EYES Demonstrator.

<p>
This package just contains the main Class
(Demonstrator) and an Interface needed at this Level. All other classes are stored in other
packages, so they are easy to find. The package hierarchy up to now is:
<ul>
	<li>components - contains AbstractComponent and its subtypes. These are the Elements that are shown by the main Frame</li>
	<li>diagram - The model and Swing classes needed to display a diagram of a Node network</li>
	<li>gui.customelements - more Swing classes. these are custom Swing Components painting needed information</li>
	<li>model - this is the first approach to the display of a Node network, as well as some other Classes modeling information needed</li>
	<li>util - contains Util classes alleviating work that is done often.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Building, running, distributing and documentation</h2>
<p>
The build control is completely taken by providing an <code>build.xml</code> file for
<a href="ant.apache.org">Ant</a>. Different tasks can be carried out for different targets.
</p>
<h3>ant compile</h3>
<p>
Compiles the source code. Resulting <code>.class</code> files are stored in the source tree.
</p>

<h3>ant run</h3>
<p>
Compiles the source code if needed and starts the main class.
</p>

<h3>ant dist</h3>
<p>
Compiles the source code (if needed). After that a <code>.jar</code> file is built and stored in the
<code>dist/</code> directory, along with a <code>lib/</code> directory containing needed libraries. The
generated .jar file is directly executable via <code>java -jar $JARNAME</code>, given that the <code>lib/</code>
directory is available. 
</p>

<h3>ant doc</h3>
<p>
Given the fact that you can read this you may already have found this target ;)<br>
It builds the Javadoc for all EYES Demonstrator classes and puts it in the <code>docs/</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>ant clean</h3>
<p>
Removes the <code>dist/</code> and <code>docs/</code> directories, as well as all <code>.class</code> Files.
