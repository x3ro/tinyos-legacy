This package contains custom Swing Compoents or other Classes needed for the GUI.

Most interesting in here is the Graph class, which is a simple Oscilloscope like
Component. Unfortunately there would be some work to do (scaling, zooming, asynchronous
adding of data) so I decided to use the PtPlot Graph in the GraphViewComponent and not my
class. It may be useful nevertheless but needs some little patching.
