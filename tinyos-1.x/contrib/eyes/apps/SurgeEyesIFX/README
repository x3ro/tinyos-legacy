Description:

Surge is an example application that uses MultiHop ad-hoc routing.  It
is designed to be used in conjunction with the Surge java tool. Each
Surge node takes temperature readings and forwards them to a base station.
The node can also respond to broadcast commands from the base.

This is an adapted version of SurgeTelos that resides in /contrib/ucb/apps/SurgeTelos. 

EyesIFX:

net.tinyos.surge.MainClass

This class processes sensor data from Surge programmed nodes via a
GenericBase station.  The java applet snoops the multihop headers to
provide a graphical view of the logical network topology.  It also
permits variation of the sample rates and sending pre-defined commands
to the surge nodes.

In tinyos-1.x/tools/java/net/tinyos/surge, you will need to edit the
Makefile to create java classes based on this version of surge.  Create
classes from Surge.h and SurgeCmd.h in contrib/eyes/apps/SurgeEyesIFX and
Multihop.h from contrib/eyes/tos/lib/MultiHopRSSI.
