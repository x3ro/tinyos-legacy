PSDemo is an application to demonstrate the publish/subscribe middleware
located tinyos-1.x/contrib/eyes/tos/lib/PublishSubscribe.
It is to be used in combination with the Eyes Demonstrator GUI in 
contrib/eyes/tools/java/de/tub/eyes/apps/demonstrator.
TOSBase needs to be programmed on the gateway node, PSDemo on all others.
Check tinyos-1.x/contrib/eyes/doc/pstutorial.pdf.


Meaning of the LEDs:
  First LED = toggles when the node has received a subscription
  Second LED = toggles when the node start gathering data
  Third LED = toggles when a notification has been sent
  Fourth LED = toggles when Drip is active
