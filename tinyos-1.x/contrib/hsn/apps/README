Current HSN Applications
Contact: Mark Yarvis (mark.d.yarvis@intel.com)

If you are using a Makelocal file in tinyOS-1.x/apps, make sure to copy
that file into hsn/apps directory before installing applications in this
folder. Do NOT redefine PFLAGS, CFLAGS and BASEDIR inside Makelocal.
Instead, use += to modify PFLAGS or CFLAGS.  Modify BASEDIR by putting
the desired path in ./BaseDIR.

To use the HSN routing layer from a tinyOS-1.x/apps application
(ex. GSK, TinyApps), modify the application's Makefile to remove
"include ../Makerules" (if present, it should be at the end of the Makefile)
with the following 4 lines:

 BASEDIR=../../tos
 HSNDIR=$(BASEDIR)/../contrib/hsn/tos
 PFLAGS += # Any additional flags you might want
 include $(HSNDIR)/../apps/MakeHSN  # This must be always at the end
