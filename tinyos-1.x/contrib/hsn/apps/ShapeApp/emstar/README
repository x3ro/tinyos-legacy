- From the devel directory in emstar, copy/link the shaped dir:
  $EMSTAR_ROOT/devel/shaped -> ShapeApp/emstar/shaped

- Add the followign line to $EMSTAR_ROOT/devel/BUILD:
  include {shaped}

- Apply the emtos.patch file while in the $EMSTAR_ROOT/mote dir.
  This patch provides:
	- the patches to mote/BUILD to build the shape client
	  into the emtos applications
	- an simple API to the stargate button for emtos apps
	- the support to use the leds on the stargate as the
	  mote leds using the --leds command

- Edit $EMSTAR_ROOT/mote/BUILD to correct location of ShapeApp.
  This needs to be set to let emstars make to know to go build the
  emtos ShapeApp binary.

- Copy shapeclient.c to $EMSTAR_ROOT/mote/libmote
  This is the client code that talk to shaped

- Copy shaped.h to $EMSTAR_ROOT/mote/emtos
  Prototypes for the above

- Copy the tdb.run file to any directory you want. You _MUST_ edit
  this file and set the paths to the programs correctly.

- Setup your emstar build environment for the Stargate or pc, and
  compile away.

- run emrun and give it the tdb.run file as an argument


RANDOM NOTES and things you should know:

- The patch sets your default mote POT setting to 3. You may want to
  set it higher.

- Putting the stargate in a metal box, and using a mote with a full
  sized antenna help with the nasty asymetric link that you get with
  all the motes set at such low POT settings. The Stargates initial
  POT is set to 3.
