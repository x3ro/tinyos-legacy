// The hardware presentation layer. See hpl.h for the C side.
// Note: there's a separate C side (hpl.h) to get access to the avr macros

// The model is that HPL is stateless. If the desired interface is as stateless
// it can be implemented here (Clock, FlashBitSPI). Otherwise you should
// create a separate component

/* Note: The btnode2_2 uses uart 0 to connect to the Bluetooth module, and
   uart 1 to connect externally. 
   uart 0 is mapped to PE0 = RXD0, PE1 = TXD0,
   uart 1 is mapped to PD2 = RXD1, PD3 = TXD1.
 
   The code below only maps uart 0, as this is the one we need for
   communication with the bluetooth hardware. */
