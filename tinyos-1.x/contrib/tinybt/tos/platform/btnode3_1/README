This is the platform specific stuff for the BTnode rev3.10. It includes port 
mappings and hw settings that are specific to this hw revision only. The BTnode 
rev3.10 is the pre version of the final BTnode rev3 and misses the extended 
memory on the ATmega128 and the extra config latch attached to PORT C. 
The LEDs and the radio power management are directly attached to PORT C.


To compile for this platform set the following environment variables:

TOSDIR=../../tos

MAKERULES=../../contrib/tinybt/apps/Makerules


Please refer to the documentation for specific information and support.
