This directory contains the Count application (which does a little
bit more than counting) and associated components. 

The most interessting components is the "Assembly" component. This
component implements the Assembly interface, which is an interface
applications can use to abstract away some of the nitty-gritty details
on running a sensor node with two bluetooth interfaces as the
communication channels. 

The component is part of this directory, because it uses modified
bluetooth and Uart components, which are also part of this
directory. Technically it could be modified to always use the one in
the main directories and just copy and modify this to get two stacks,
but the approach with two complete copies have been choosen to make
this application less dependent on the changes in the main
directories.

A couple of scripts are provided to make it easier to get the
modifications from the main directories into this:

diff_to_tos -       diffes one set of bluetooth files against the ones
                    in the main directories
modules_0_to_1.sh - Converts from 0 files to 1 files. Some issues needs
                    to be handled manually for HCIPacket1M.nc

See also the modules themselves - make the docs for further
explanations. Especially the CountM documentation.
