This program is a simple test application that introduces a lot of the
different parts of setting up the Bluetooth module in a TinyBT
application. The application will output status information throughout
the entire process on the free UART (UART1).

The application will start and initialize the Bluetooth module,
perform a scan in order to find other Bluetooth hardware around, and
enable page scan and inqury scan on the module (making it discoverable
and connectable).

Then the application will wait for a connection. When a connected is
initated, the application will accept it, and try to print the packets
it receive through the connection (so it is good if the packets
include a zero-terminated string).

None of this involves the higher-level Bluetooth protocols (such as
RFCOMM and L2CAP). So an application that wishes to send to this test
application must use ACL to communicate with the node.
