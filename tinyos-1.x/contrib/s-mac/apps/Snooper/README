1. INTRODUCTION

   The snooper listens all packets and send them to UART. So you can use
tools/snoop.c to receive and display the packet contents on PC.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

   The snooper streams each byte in a received packet to the UART. When it is
connected with the PC through the programming board and the serial port, you can
display the each packet on PC by using tools/snoop.c. snoop.c is modified from
the listen.c, which awares variable length packets.

3. HOW TO USE

   Simply type 'make mica' and/or 'make install mica'.

4. NOTES

   The implementation assumes that the speed of the UART is faster than the data
arrival rate (after decoding) on the radio.
