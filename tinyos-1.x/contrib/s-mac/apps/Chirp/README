README for Chirp running over S-MAC without modification
Author/Contact: weiye@isi.edu

Description:

The application is copied from tinyos-1.x/apps/Chirp/ to demonstrate the
compatibility provided by S-MAC stack that allows applications developed on 
standard UCB's stack (based on GenericComm and AMStandard) to run over
S-MAC with out any modifications.

There is no modifications in ChirpM.nc and ChirpMsg.h. The only modification
in Chirp.nc is to include config.h at its beginning. config.h is used to 
configure S-MAC. For example, in the Chirp application, S-MAC is configured
to run in fully active mode (no sleep cycles). If config.h file is not
included by Chirp.nc, default configurations of S-MAC will be used (10% duty
cycle with adaptive listen, and packets won't be sent if no neighbor is
discovered).

Makefile is modified to include correct search paths.
