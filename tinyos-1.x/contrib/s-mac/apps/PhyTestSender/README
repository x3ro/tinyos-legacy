1. INTRODUCTION

   This application tests the Physical Layer (PHY) developed at USC/ISI and
UCLA. The primary component of the physical layer that provides the interface
to upper layer is PHY_RADIO. The mote programmed by this application is a
transmitter that sends out different lengths of packets in different packet
intervals.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

   There are 4 groups of packets to be sent

1) Fixed-length packets with a fixed packet interval defined by
   TST_PKT_INTERVAL.
2) Variable-length packets with the same fixed packet interval,
   TST_PKT_INTERVAL.
3) Fixed-length packets without packet interval (back-to-back), i.e, start
   sending the second packet as soon as sending the first packet is done.
4) Variable-length packets without packet interval (back-to-back).

3. HOW TO USE

   To use all the default parameters, simply type 'make mica' and/or 'make
install mica'.

   The following parameters can be defined in the config.h file. If not 
defined, default values will be used.
   
 Parameter               Description                    Default Value
 
PHY_MAX_PKT_LEN  Maximum pkt length                        100 bytes
TST_NUM_PKTS     Number of pkts being sent in each group   100
TST_PKT_INTERVAL Fixed pkt interval for group 1 and 2      10 ms
TST_GRP_INTERVAL Pause time between each group             1000 ms


4. NOTES

1) This application is to be used with a receiver part, which is at
apps/PhyTestReceiver/.

2) You can use a snooper (at apps/Snooper/) to see the contents of each packet.
Please note that the sender does NOT clean the memory for each packet. So when
sending variable length packets, a long packet following a short packet will
contain all the payload of the short packet. Don't simply think that packet is
corrupted because of the non-zero payload.
