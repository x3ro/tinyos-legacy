1. INTRODUCTION

   This application tests the Physical Layer (PHY) developed at USC/ISI and
UCLA. The primary component of the physical layer that provides the interface
to upper layer is PHY_RADIO. The mote programmed by this application is a
receiver that counts the number of succesfully received packets and packets
that are received with errors.

   The transmitter part is at apps/PhyTestSender/.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

   The receiver records the following values, and toggle LEDs when a packet is
successfully received.

* Number start symbol detections
* Number of 'length' (the first field in a packet) errors
* Number of CRC errors
* Number of received packets without any errors

   At the end of each group of packets sent by the sender, the receiver sends
out a packet to report its above results.
   
3. HOW TO USE

   To use all the default parameters, simply type 'make mica' and/or 'make
install mica'.

   The following parameters can be defined in the config.h file. If not 
defined, their default values will be used.
   
 Parameter               Description                    Default Value
 
PHY_MAX_PKT_LEN  Maximum pkt length allowed by PHY         100 bytes
TST_NUM_PKTS     Number of pkts being sent in each group   100


4. NOTES

1) This application is to be used with a transmitter part, which is at
apps/PhyTestSender/.

2) You can use a snooper (at apps/Snooper/) to see the contents of each packet
sent by the sender as well as the report packet sent by the receiver at the end
of each group.
