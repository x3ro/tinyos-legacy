The following files need to be synchronized 
with the same named files in the TinyOS tree,
in the tos/sensorboards directory:

MicaWBSwitch.nc
MicaWBSwitchM.nc
Switch.nc

In the future, it would be good to get rid of these 
files completely, and just use the files in the tree,
but that is a sticky include problem because they 
are located with some other code we don't want.
