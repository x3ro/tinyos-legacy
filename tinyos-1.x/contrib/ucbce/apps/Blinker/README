Description:

Blinker is an application that demonstrates the use 
of interfaces for handling events.  In this case, 
the interface defines a Blink event, which is 
signaled from the BlinkM module, and caught 
by the implementation in BlinkerM. The application is 
built on the Blink program described in the TinyOS 
tutorial.
