DESCRIPTION:

The GradientPolicy component is used to convergecast messages to a stationary
base station. This policy has to be used together with the FloodRouting component.
The GradientPolicy first calculates the hop count distance from the root,
then based on this information forwards packets. Tha basic idea is that if the 
same packet is heard from a node closer to the root than the currect node, 
then the packet is not sent from this node. Otherwise, we send each packet up to
three times (with 2 and 1 sec delays in between). 

HOP COUNT:

The hop count measurement (gradient calculation) is initiated by calling the 
GradientPolicy.setRoot() method on the root node. The hop count distance from the 
root is measured 16 times, and the final hop count distance is the average of the 
measured hop counts. 

ONE POSSIBLE USAGE:

Include the RemoteControl component to your application. Program all motes with 
this application, and program one mote with the GenericBase application. Turn all 
motes on, and select the one of your application mote that is relatively close 
(or the closest) to the base station. This mote will be the root of the convergecast.
The base station will overhear the communication (either the ones that are sent
towards to base station, or the ones that are sent by the base station as 
acknowledgments) and can forward these packets to the PC. First, you have to tell
the selected mote that it is the root. You can do this with the RemoteControl
java panel of the MessageCenter application and with the following configuration:

	configuration:	"set gradient root"
	usage:	"type the node id of a mote close to TOSBase mote into 
		the target field"
	command target:
	command appID:	0x81
	integer parameter:	2

After this, you can display the remote control acknowledgments, as well 
as your routed messages at the base station using the MessageTable application 
with the following configuration:

	configuration: "remote control acknowledgments"
	msg type:	130
	check first unique only
	format:
		const hex8 appId = 0x5E
		omit uint16 gradient
		unique uint16 nodeId
		uint8 seqNum
		uint8 retVal

The GradientPolicy supports the following remote commands, as well:
		
	configuration:	"query the gradient root"
	usage:	"returns the root of the gradient field of each nodes"
	command target:	0xFFFF
	command appID:	0x81
	integer parameter:	0

	configuratgion:	"query the hop count of the gradient field"
	command target:	0xFFFF
	command appID:	0x81
	integer parameter:	1
