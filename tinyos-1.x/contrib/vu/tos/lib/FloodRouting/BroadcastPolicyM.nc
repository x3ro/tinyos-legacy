/**
  *     The BroadcastPolicy module is the most simple policy. It resends every message
  *     it heard exactly once. It remembers the packet for 5 seconds till it last heard 
  *     it. This ensures that same data packet is not resent if it has already 
  *     passed through this node.
  *
  *	Finite state automaton for the policy based on the priority:
  *
  *	priority states:
  *		even - packet created/received that has not been sent by the current
  *			mote; waiting for sending
  *		odd - packet has been sent by the current mote, but we still keep
  *			it for some time, while it's being broadcasted by the motes 
  *			around; to avoid the same packet resending
  *
  *	//after sending, keep the packet in routing buffer for a while
  *	0 --sent--> 3
  *	
  *	//when the packet is new (0), and it was received from some neighboring mote,
  *	//decrease its priority over new packets, but still leave it scheduled for
  *	//transmission (even) 
  *	0 --received--> 2 --sent--> 3
  *
  *	//aging off the packets that were sent already
  *	3 --tick--> 5 --tick--> 7 --tick--> 9 --tick--> 11 --tick--> 0xFF
  *
  *	//whenever a packet, that already has been sent, is received again
  *	//we reset the timer that purges it from the routing buffer
  *	//this avoids the same message resending
  *	5,7,9,11 --received--> 3
