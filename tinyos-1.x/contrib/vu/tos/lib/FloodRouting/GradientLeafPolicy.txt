GradientLeafPolicy:

DESCRIPTION:

The GradientLeafPolicy can be used in conjunction with the GradientPolicy in
non-heterogenious networks. If some nodes are "leaf" nodes, that possibly can
be suspended and/or turned on/off, and do not participate in the routing then
this less resource hungry version of the GradientPolicy can be used. In 
particular, these leaf nodes with this policy can have a very small buffer 
(one that can hold only one or two data packets plus 10 bytes). The non-leaf 
nodes must form a "back-bone" of the network and all must be used with the 
GradientPolicy together with larger buffers.
