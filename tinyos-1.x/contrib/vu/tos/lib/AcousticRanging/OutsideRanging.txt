DESCRIPTION:

The OutsideRangingActuator and OutsideRangingSensor components provide acoustic 
ranging capability using the standard MICA sensorboard microphone and buzzer. 
These components use the AcousticBeacon and AcousticMultiSampler components to perform
the low level operations. 

LIMITATIONS:

- This algorithm is optimized for OUTSIDE and STATIONARY use. Inside buildings there can
be substantially more echoes. We plan to release an acoustic ranger for inside use and 
for moving targets.


ALGORITHM:

- First we emit a radio signal. The SendMsg.sendDone and ReceiveMsg.receive events are
used to synchronize the acoustic beacon and acoustic rangers.

- When receiving the radio signal, we turn on the microphone. Both sides wait 0.5 seconds
for the microphone to power up.

- Then we emit 16 buzzes, each of which is 122 millisecond long. The acoustic ranger samples
each of the buzzes by streaming the microphone (950 samples per buzz) and adds these samples
together. The sampling frequency is around 15600 HZ.

- By sampling 16 times we increase the signal to noise ratio. Also, we vary the delay 
between the buzzes to eliminate some of the unwanted echoes and other motes' buzzes.

- Once the recording is done, we use a 35-length digital filter (with integer coefficients)
to filter out the 4-5 KHZ range.

- Then we run a nice peak detection algorithm to detect the start of the buzz.

- Finally, we convert the range to centimeters.
