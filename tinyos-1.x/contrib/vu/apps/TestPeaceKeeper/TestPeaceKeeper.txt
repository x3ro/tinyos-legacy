DESCRIPTION:

The TestPeaceKeeper verifies that the PeaceKeeper component works correctly. The 
PeaceKeeper component helps detecting RAM corruption caused by the stack growing
large and overwriting component variables. To see what happens when the stack 
overwrites the memory of components uncomment the first line in TestPeaceKeeperM.nc.
Please see the PeaceKeeper.txt documentation in the lib directory.
