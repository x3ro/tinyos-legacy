<h1>Testbed Config</h1>
Author: Rodrigo Fonseca (rfonseca at cs.berkeley.edu)

<p>This is the description for a set of tools to interface with static ethernet testbeds. It consists of a *very*
simple configuration specification, a perl module and a java class to parse it, and a set of scripts and programs (perl, 
bash, and java).

<h2> Configuration File Format </h2>
The configuration file is very simple, and the parser is not very robust.
All lines starting with '#' are ignored, as well as blank lines.

A line starting with <pre>platform</pre> indicates the platform that the testbed uses. Currently,
we assume all motes to be of the same platform.

A line starting with <pre>mote</pre> specifies a ... mote! The format is:
<pre>mote &lt;id&gt; &lt;ip address&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; </pre>.

<p>
x and y are used by some other scripts, for example to draw graphs of the testbed, etc.

<h2> Utilities </h2>
<h3> Environment Variables </h3>
<pre>
  TOS_TESTBED_CONFIG - some scripts expect this to point to the testbed configuration file you want to use
</pre>
<h3> Programming motes </h3>
<pre>testbed-program.pl</pre> is a wrapper to the rsc scripts that reads from a configuration file and
allows interaction with the testbed (programming, pinging, etc). It requires an extra argument,
<pre>--testbed=<file></pre>, that indicates the file.

<h3> Running Experiments </h3>
<p>
The format of experiments I am currently running creates a serial forwarder to each mote,
which forwards the data to and from port 9100 + mote id. 
The reason for this is that this indirection is useful if you want to multiplex access to the motes:
otherwise, if you connect directly to the mote from the packet logger, you can't open a second connection simultaneously.
I use this to log and at the same time send commands to the motes.
<p>
Use <pre> testbed_start_sf.pl </pre> to start the serial forwarders. It reads the config file from <pre>$TOS_TESTBED_CONFIG</pre>
and starts them.

<p> Then start <pre>java net.tinyos.testbed.TestBedPacketLogger &lt;testbed config file&gt; &lt;time&gt; to run(seconds)></pre>.
This will log all packets that the motes send to the UART to a binary file, and
to STDOUT in textual format. 

<p>The format of the text output is:
<pre>
  <id> <time in ms> <hex short>
</pre>

<p>id and time are decimal numbers, and the other bytes are 0X (hex) representations of
the packet bytes.

<p>The format of the binary output is as follows. The byte order is whatever java's DataOutputStream writes.
<pre>
  short id;
  long  time;
  short packet_length;
  byte[packet_length] packet;
</pre>


<h2> Using the Perl Module </h2>

The perl module TinyOS::Util::TestBedConfig is useful for creating simple iterators over the motes in a given testbed
configuration. testbed-program.pl, eraselabapp.pl, and resetlabapp.pl provide nice examples os the usage.

<h3> 1. Make the module accessible:</h3>

Place it into a directory, such as /path/to/TinyOS/Util/TestBedConfig.pm

Add the directory to you environment variable:

<pre>
  export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/path/to/scripts  (bash) or <br>
  setenv PERL5LIB $PERL5LIB:/path/to/scripts
</pre>

<h3> 2. Use it</h3>

Quick help

<pre>
   use TinyOS::Util::TestBedConfig;
   $cfg = TinyOS::Util::TestBedConfig->new($config_file);
   $n = cfg->getNumberOfMotes();
</pre>

Iterating over the motes

<pre>
   my @mote_array;
   $cfg->getMotes(\@mote_array);
   for $mote (@mote_array) {
      $address = $mote->{'address'};
      $id      = $mote->{'id'};
      $x       = $mote->{'x'};
      $y       = $mote->{'y'}; 
      #do whatever you want
   }
</pre>
Other calls:
<pre>
   $moteref = getMote($id);
   getMotes(\@array);
   $n = getNumberOfMotes();
   $platform = getPlatform();
</pre>

The array of motes returned by getMotes() is an array of hash references with the following keys:

<ul>
<li> 'address' is the ip address or host name of the mote
<li> 'id' is the mote id (TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS for the mote)
<li> 'x' is the x coordinate of the mote in the testbed
<li> 'y' is the y coordinate of the mote in the testbed
</ul>

<h2> Using the Java Class </h2>

The java class, net.tinyos.testbed.TestBedConfig, has a very similar usage.
It is used, for example, by TestBedPacketLogger to create the packet listeners.
The main method also provides an example.

<h3> Method summary</h3>
