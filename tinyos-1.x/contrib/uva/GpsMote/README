README for GpsMote

Author/Contact: rs6bd@cs.virginia.edu

Description: GpsMote is an application that allows an external GPS device 
(i.e. Garmin eTrex Legend) to be connected and communicate with a mote through 
the serial port. NMEA messages sent by the GPS device are parsed by the mote, 
and the global GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude in decimal minutes) 
present in the $GPGLL records are converted into a local Cartesian coordinate 
sytem. These local coordinates, as well as the origin of the local coordinate 
system (reference point), are then broadcast at periodic intervals. 

Tools: The calculator.xls spreadsheet can help in converting the GPS 
coordinates of the reference point from dd mm.mmmm (NMEA 1803) format to a more
compact (8 bytes total) format that uses 1/1000 of a second.

Known Bugs: none
