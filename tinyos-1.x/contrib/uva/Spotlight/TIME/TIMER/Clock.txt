README for real time Clock

Author/Contact: <a href="mailto:miklos.maroti@vanderbilt.edu">miklos.maroti@vanderbilt.edu</a> (Miklos Maroti, ISIS, Vanderbilt)

DESCRIPTION:

Here you will find a high precision real time clock (with 1/32768 sec 
resolution). It extends the functionality of the native Clock component in 
TinyOS 1.x. To use this implementation, simply copy the 4 files named Clock* 
and the LocalTime.nc interface to your directory where you compile your 
application. The NesC compiler will find and use these files instead of the ones 
in the library. Existing components should not be affected. Note, that the Clock 
must be started to get access to the real time clock. This can be accomplished 
by using the Timer component (or the GenericComm which automatically starts the 
Timer). Note, this implementation works only on the MICA platform (ATmega103 or ATmega128).

FILES:

The Clock interface (Clock.nc) has been extended to support the setting and 
retrieval of the current (actual) clock rate in 1/32768 seconds units.

The Clock header file (Clock.h) containing predefined rates has been updated. It 
contained a few incorrect values. Specifically, if the scaling is 1 and the 
interval is N, then the interrupt actually occurs at every (N+1)/32768 seconds. 
Other predefined values have been modified to get higher resolution of the real 
time clock (Like Ted Herman suggested).

The LocalTime interface (LocalTime.nc) has been included to set and retrieve the 
current time. This file is copied from Ted Herman's TsyncM service.

The Clock module (ClockM.nc and ClockC.nc) implements both the original Clock 
interface and the LocalTime interface. It has functions to convert clock rates 
between the formats (scale + interval) and rate in 1/32768 second. Time is 
guaranteed to be monotonic. The internal functions access and update the current 
time atomically and take into account the quirks of the hardware.

TESTING:

Two testing components have been included. VerifyClock1 is used to verify the 
actual interrupt rates for various (scale + interval) pairs. The TestClock1 
component is used to verify that the real time clock is monotonic and is 
accurate.

LIMITATIONS:

If the Clock is not started, then the current time counter is not advanced.

To get high precision (1/32768 sec), the Clock component must be started with 
scaling of 1. The native implementation of Timer in TinyOS-1.x does start the 
Clock, but not necessarily in the highest resolution. Specifically, the 
GenericComm component uses one Timer to gather network traffic statistics. The 
interrupt rate for that is only 1 per second, which does not yield the best 
resolution for the real time clock. One can help this by using a dummy Timer 
with high enough interrupt rate.
