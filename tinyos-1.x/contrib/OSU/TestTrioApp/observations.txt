Description:

Scheduler - simply calls getSample on PIR every 75ms
PIRDetectorM - gets ADC sample, computes stats, writes stats to UART every 75 ms
	         if detected signals event to Aggregator
Aggregator - initializes everything, event handlers for detection events
             wires to KrakenC

Expt setup
==========
NO_xxx = TRUE for everything except SENSORS and UART in Makefile 
NO_PROMETHEUS=TRUE as well
On startup: trio beeps 

Config 1:
=========
Use NO_DELUGE in Makefile
Comment out in KrakenC.nc the 2 lines
StdControl = GrouperC;
StdControl = RemoteC;

This eliminates all modules that can send radio msg (my app doesnt have any radio sends)
Observation: Data rcvd on serial port at 14Hz

Config 2:
=========
Include Deluge in Makefile
Keep GrouperC and RemoteC commented
Observation: Serial messages dont come through, if you reset node, may see 1-2msgs in SF
