<h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examples</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><!-- <p>Agilla brings the benefits of mobile

    agents and Linda-like tuplespaces into the realm of sensor networks. Mobile

    agents and tuplespaces are widely used in traditional distributed computing

    environments, but they have yet to be used in sensor networks due,

    in part, to their novelty and severe resource constraints. Agilla demonstrates

    that mobile agents and tuplespaces can not only be used in existing sensor

    networks, but

    can, in fact, provide more benefits than they did in traditional

    ones. Unlike normal programs, Agilla programs are implemented as one

    or more autonomous agents that can control where and when they

    execute, and how they interact with other agents and tuplespaces.

    This intelligent behavior naturally provides in-network

    reprogramming, greater flexibility, and better network utilization.

    Tuplespaces offer a high degree of decoupling, allowing agents to

    work independently while still being able to communicate. Using Agilla as

  a foundation, we can explore these benefits and determine how to best tailor

    it to the limited

    resources of sensor networks and

    the unique requirements of their applications. Agilla has been implemented

     on top of TinyOS and has been tested on a mock multihop wireless network

    consisting of 16-node MICA2 nodes (the nodes must be arranged in a grid,

  multihop

    is achieved via message filtering).</p>
