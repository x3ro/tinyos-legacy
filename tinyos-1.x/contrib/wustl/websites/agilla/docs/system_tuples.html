          <h1>System Tuples</h1>

          <p>There are two special types of tuples automatically inserted into

            the tuple space by Agilla: 1) Agent Tuples and 2) Host Tuples. For

            each agent running on a node, Agilla inserts an Agent tuple containing

            the agent's ID. The tuple has two fields where the first is a string &quot;aid&quot; and

            the second is an AgentID. When the agent terminates or migrates off

            the host, Agilla automatically removes the agent tuple. This tuple

            is useful to determine which agents are residing on a particular

            host. The Host tuple is inserted to allow an agent to discover the

            location of neighboring nodes. It has two fields, the first being

            the string &quot;hid&quot; and the second being a location (the location

            of the host).</p>

          <p>The group probing operations has not been implemented yet. Once

            it is, an agent can perform a group probe on the tuplespace to determine

            the locations of neighboring hosts and agents.</p>
