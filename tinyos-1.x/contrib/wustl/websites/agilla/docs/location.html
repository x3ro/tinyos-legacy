          <h1>Location-Based

              Addressing</h1>

          <p>Agilla addresses each node by its location rather than its TinyOS

            ID because the spatial properties of the network are vital to sensor

            network applications, particularly those written using multiple mobile

            agents. To operate effectively, mobile agents need to know their

            location to coordinate with each other, and to correlate sensor data

            with the location from which they were obtained. Having a sensor

            reading without its location is not useful. For example, if an agent

            takes a temperature reading and determines that there is a fire,

            it cannot simply tell a base station &quot;fire&quot; but rather &quot;fire

            at (1,2).&quot; By utilizing a location-centric addressing scheme,

            Agilla provides a unified way of identifying nodes, and allows its

            primitives to be generalized to operate over regions (e.g., <strong>out</strong> a

            tuple into all tuplespaces within a geographic region). </p>
