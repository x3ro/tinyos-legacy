          <h1>The Network

              Topology: An n x m Grid</h1>

          <p><em><font color="#FF0000">Note:</font> The following documentation
              is for Agilla 2.x. Agilla 3.x and beyond (the version available
              off the SourceForge CVS server) does not enforce the grid topology.
              For the Agilla 1.x, click <a href="network_topology_1x.html">here</a>.</em></p>
          <p> Agilla
  
            creates an artificial multi-hop sensor network arranged in an <em>n</em> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">x</font> <em>m</em> grid
            by filtering out messages from non-neighbors. A node 
            can only communicate with its immediate neighbors based on the grid
            topology, i.e., each node in the grid 
              can communicate with its immediate horizontal, vertical, and diagonal
  
              neighbors, for a maximum of 8 neighbors. A node is identified
            by its (x,y) location, which is calculated based on its address.
             <strong>Only one node can be located at a particular (x,y) location
             at a time.</strong> The network grid is arranged in row-major order
             starting with location (1,1)
            at the
            corner.
            The
            mote
            connected
            to
  
              the base station is treated like a regular node, it can be at
            any valid grid location and its neighbors are based on its position
             in the grid. Note that this differs from Agilla 1.x where the base
             station was treated as a special case with an address of (0,0) and
             the entire first row as its immediate neighbors. In Agilla 2.x,
             the base station can move and is treated like any other node.</p>
          <p>The grid location and node address is calculated as follows:</p>

          <p align="center"><em>ID = </em>(<em>x</em> - 1)<em>+ </em>(<em>y </em>- 1)
              <em>* (number of columns)</em></p>

          <p>Alternatively, given the node ID, its location can be calculated

            as follows:</p>

          <p align="center"><em>x = </em>[(<em>ID</em>) mod (<em>number of columns</em>)]
              + 1<em><br>
            y = </em>(<em>ID &#8211; x</em> + 1)/(<em>number of columns</em>) + 1</p>

          <p>For example, in a 4x4 network, the nodes would have the following

            IDs and locations:<br>
</p>
          <p align="center"><img src="4x4_network_2x.jpg" width="425" height="419">
</p>
          <p align="center">&nbsp;            </p>

          <p>Agilla implements a simple greedy-forwarding where each agent simply

            looks at its neighbors and forwards a message to whichever neighbor

            is closer to the ultimate destination. If there are no neighbors
            closer to the destination than the node itself, the migration and
            tuple space access operation will fail. It does not adopt to node

            failure or perform neighbor discovery.</p>

          <h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Customizing</font></h2>

          <p>The default grid size is specified by the number of columns. It
            is specified by DEFAULT_NUM_COLUMNS in <em>&lt;agilla&gt;/types/Agilla.h</em> and
by NUM_COLUMNS in 
            <em>&lt;java&gt;/edu/wustl/mobilab/agilla/variables/AgillaLocation.java</em>.
            After changing the default number of columns, the java AgentInjector
            application and the NesC both have to be recompiled. The NesC code
            has to be reinstalled on all motes.</p>

          <p>To install the NesC portion of Agilla, you can use an included

            gawk script that streamlines the installation process. Use it by

            going to <em>&lt;agilla&gt;</em> and

              typing <em>gawk -f installer_m2.awk</em> for Mica2 motes, or <em>gawk

              -f installer_mz.awk </em>for MicaZ motes. Alternatively, if you

              added the <a href="../download/index.html#AgillaAliases">Agilla

              aliases</a> to

              your /etc/profile, just type <em>riall_m2 </em>or <em>riall_mz </em>anywhere

              for Mica2 and MicaZ motes, respectively.</p>

          <p>To recompile the Java portion, type <em>mj</em> if you have the <a href="../download/index.html#AgillaAliases">Agilla

            aliases</a> setup, or go to <em>&lt;java&gt;/edu/wustl/mobilab/agilla/variables/</em> and

            type <em>make</em>.</p>

          <p>Agilla 2.x allows you to change the grid topology and a node's location
            wirelessly. You can start the AgentInjector with a &quot;-col NUM_COL&quot;
            option, which will change the default number of columns within the
            AgentInjector. You can change the number of columns within the
            sensor network by going to the WSN menu and selecting &quot;&quot;Change Grid
            Topology,&quot; or by
            hitting
            ctrl+g.
            To
            change
            a node's
            location. Note that the grid size within the network MUST match the
            grid size within the AgentInjector java application.</p>
