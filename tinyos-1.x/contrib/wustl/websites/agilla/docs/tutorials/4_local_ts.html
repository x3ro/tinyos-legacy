          <p>Each mote has its own independent tuple space. Agilla provides 6
            <a href="../../isa.html#LocalTS">instructions</a> for
            accessing the local tuple space. They are listed below with their
            parameters in parenthesis:</p>

          <p>Agilla agents use a stack architecture. Tuples and templates are
            created by pushing their fields onto the stack, followed by the number
            of fields. The order of the fields on the stack represents the order
            that they appear in the tuple. For example, the code for inserting
            tuple            &lt;int:1,
            int:2, string:&quot;abc&quot;,
            loc:(1,1)&gt;            and insert it into the local tuple space
            is:</p>
<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/out_example.ma</pre>
<pre class="screen">
	pushloc 1 1
	pushn abc
	pushc 2
	pushc 1
	pushc 4  	// 4 fields in the tuple
	out		// insert tuple
	halt</pre>
	
          <p>Note that since the stack is LIFO, the last field of the
            tuple is pushed first. The tuple space provides <em>hard state</em>.
            Tuples inserted in the tuple space remain there indefinitely even
            if the agent that inserted it no longer exists. Tuples are moved
            using instructions <a href="../../isa/in.html"><code>in</code></a> and <a href="../../isa/inp.html"><code>inp</code></a>. </p>
          <p>The maximum number of fields a tuple can have is limited by the
            maximum size of the tuple, which is by default 18 bytes as defined
            by AGILLA_MAX_TUPLE_SIZE within <code>$WUAPPS/Agilla/types/TupleSpace.h</code>.
            This value
            was chosen to ensure
            a tuple can fit within a single TinyOS message. The size
            of a tuple or template's field is the size of the variable within
            the
            field
            +
            1. Variables sizes are given <a href="../variables.html">here</a>.
            The extra byte within every field is used to indicate the variable
            type. In addition, the tuple contains a byte for flags (e.g., whether
            the tuple was inserted by the middleware, or by an agent), and a
            byte to indicate the number of fields. Thus, the total size of a
            tuple is the sum of its fields plus 2. For example, the tuple in
            the example above would contains 3+3+3+5+2=14 bytes.</p>
          <p>The middleware automatically inserts a HostID tuple containing &lt;&quot;hid&quot;,
            value&gt;, and an AgentID tuple consisting of &lt;&quot;aid&quot;,
            value&gt;. The value
            within the HostID tuple is the address of the local host. The value
            within an AgentID tuple is the unique ID of an agent. Both the HostID
            and AgentID tuples are 8 bytes (string = 3, value = 3, header = 2).</p>
          <p>To retrieve a tuple from the local tuple space, you need to supply
            a template that matches the tuple. A template is the same as a tuple
            except some of its fields may wild cards that match by type.
            A match occurs when the template and tuple have the same number of
            fields, and each field within the tuple matches that of a template.
            If the template's field is a not a wild card, the tuple's
            field must match exactly. This form of matching is called &quot;<em>match
            by value</em>.&quot;
            However, if the template's field is a wild-card variable, then the
            tuple's field
            must
            simply be of
            the
            same
            type.
            This form of matching is called &quot;<em>match by type</em>.&quot; Note
            that a type-variable may match &quot;ANY&quot; other type, in which
            case a match
            always occurs. The template may contain any mix of match-by-value
            and match-by-type fields. For example, the following agent pushes
            a template that is exactly the same as the tuple; it matches every
            field by value:</p>
<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/inp_example.ma</pre>
          <pre class="screen">

          <p align="left">If

<p align="left">If the above agent is injected, the red LED should turn on.</p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="rxn"></a>Reactions</h2>
<p align="left">An agent can also register <em>reactions</em>. A reaction
  allows an agent to respond to the presence
              of a tuple in the local tuple space. It is used to prevent the
  agent from having to poll for a tuple, which is inefficient.
  Reactions consist of a template,
              address, and a block of code. The template specifies when the reaction
  should fire. When a reaction fires, the agent's current PC and
  the matching tuple are pushed onto the stack. The agent's program counter is
  then changed to the reaction's address, which points to the first instruction
  in
  the
  reaction's code. The reaction's code is called the reaction's &quot;callback
  function&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">A reaction's callback function has the following structure:</p>
<pre class="screen">BEGINRXN	...
		...
		...
		endrxn</pre>
<p align="left">The first instruction should be labeled so its address can be
  pushed onto the stack when registering the reaction. In this case, the label
  is &quot;BEGINRXN&quot;. A label can be any arbitrary string with no spaces.
  The last instruction must be <a href="../../isa/endrxn.html"><code>endrxn</code></a>,
  which tells
  Agilla when the agent finishes executing the callback function.  To
  prevent race conditions, a reaction's callback function is <strong>non-preemptable</strong>.
  If there
  are
  multiple tuples matching the reaction's
  template, or if there are multiple reactions belonging to the same agent that
  are all enabled (i.e., can fire), all of the reactions will eventually fire,
  one at a time. If a matching tuple appears in the midst of another reaction,
  the reaction sensitive to the tuple will only be fired after the current reaction
  is finished. <code>endrxn</code> expects
  there to be a value on top of the stack. This value is the address of
  the next instruction to
  execute
  after
  finishing
  executing a callback function. <code>endrxn</code> changes
  the program counter to be this value. By default, Agilla pushes the address
  of the instruction that the agent was executing before the reaction fired onto
  the stack. This address may be used by <code>endrxn</code> to resume the agent
  running where it left off prior to handling a reaction.</p>
<p align="left">Agilla reactions are <em>asynchronous</em> and <em>weak</em>.
  They are asynchronous in that a matching tuple may be inserted and removed
  into the local tuple space without the reaction ever getting a chance to fire.
  They
  are weak in that when a matching
  tuple is placed in the tuple space, the reaction may
  not immediately fire. However, if the matching tuple remains,
  the reaction is guaranteed to <em>eventually</em> fire. This is in contrast
  to a <em>strong</em> reaction, which is guaranteed to fire at the first chance
  possible (i.e., when the
  agent is not already executing another reaction's callback function,
  and is not blocked on another operation).</p>
<p align="left">A reaction is designed to be executed quickly and atomically.
  It is analogous to a TinyOS event. An agent cannot execute blocking operations
  like <a href="../../isa/in.html"><code>in</code></a>, <a href="../../isa/rd.html"><code>rd</code></a>,  <a href="../../isa/wait.html"><code>wait</code></a>,
  or <a href="../../isa/sleep.html">sleep</a> while executing a reaction's call-back
  function.</p>
<p align="left">To register a reaction, the agent pushes a template and an address
  onto the stack. It then calls <strong><a href="../../isa/regrxn.html">regrxn</a></strong>. For example, consider
  the following agent:</p>
<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/regrxn_example.ma</pre>
<pre class="screen">
		pusht VALUE
		pushc 1
		pushc DORXN
		regrxn			// register reaction (addr=BLINKRED, template=<int:1>)
		
// continuously blink green LED
BLINKGREEN	pushc 26
		putled
		pushc 1
		sleep
		rjump BLINKGREEN

// The reaction callback function
DORXN		pop
		pop			// pop tuple off stack
		pushc BLINKRED		// push address BLINKRED onto stack
		endrxn			// end reaction & jump to BLINKRED
		
BLINKRED	pushc 25
		putled			// toggle red LED
		pushc 1
		sleep			// sleep for 1/8s
		pushc 25
		putled			// toggle red LED
		jumps			// jump back to address before rxn occurred</pre>
<p align="left">The   agent above registers a reaction using
            template &lt;type:value&gt; and
            address BLINKRED.  The agent is programmed to continuously blink
            the green LED, and blink the red LED when the reaction fires.
            The reaction's
            callback function starts at BLINKRED and continues to the end. Note
            that the first instruction is <a href="../../isa/inp.html">inp</a>.
            This removes the tuple from the tuple space. The following two instructions
            are both <code><a href="../../isa/pop.html">pop</a></code>.
            This
            is necessary
            because
            the tuple that caused the reaction to fire is stored on the agent's
stack.</p>
          <p align="left">The following &quot;provocateur&quot; agent can be
            used to cause the agent above to fire its reaction, assuming
            the agent
            above is injected
            onto
            node (1,1):</p>
<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/provocateur.ma</pre>
<pre class="screen">
	pushc 50
	pushc 1		// push tuple <int:50>
	pushloc 1 1
	rout		// remote out tuple to location (1,1)
	pushc 25
	putled		// blink red LED
	halt
</pre>
          <p align="left">If the provocateur agent is injected onto node (0,0),
            while the reaction agent is injected onto node (1,1), the reaction
            agent will react to the tuple and blink its red LED. </p>
          <p align="left">Unlike tuples in a tuple space, reactions belong to
            the agent that registered it and remains with the agent across strong
            migrations. Reactions are explicitly deregistered using         
            instruction <strong><a href="../../isa/deregrxn.html">deregrxn</a></strong>.</p>
          <h2><a name="wait"></a>Waiting for a Reaction to Fire</h2>
          <p>Agilla provides the special instruction <code><a href="../../isa/wait.html">wait</a></code> that
            pauses an agent until a tuple arrives. If the agent only has one
            reaction
            registered, this instruction has the same behavior as <code><a href="../../isa/in.html">in</a></code>.
            However, if more than one reaction is registered, the agent can be
            woken up if a tuple matching <em>either</em> template is inserted
            into the local tuple space. Thus, <a href="../../isa/wait.html">wait</a> is more flexible than <a href="../../isa/in.html">in</a>.
             The following is an example agent that registers two reactions and
            waits.</p>
<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/wait_exmaple.ma</pre>

		jumps</pre>
<P align="left">Notice that the reaction code is extremely short. They simply
  clear the stack, and then jump to another non-reaction block of code. This
  is necessary because reactions cannot perform the <a href="../../isa/sleep.html">sleep</a> instruction within
  their callback function. Once you have injected the above agent, 
you can inject one of the agents below that out tuples that cause the reactions
  to
fire. The first agent inserts a tuple containing a string, causing the reaction
  that blinks the red LED to fire. The second agent inserts a tuple containing
  a value, causing the reaction that blinks the green LED to fire.</P>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><a name="timing"></a>Waiting a Certain Amount of Time for Reactions to Fire</h2>
<p>Sometimes it may be useful to register a reaction, and then to wait a specified
  amount of time during which the reaction may fire multiple times. After this
  time has passed, the agent will continue operating. To achieve this behavior,
  an agent can register its reactions, then execute instruction <a href="../../isa/sleep.html"><code>sleep</code></a>.
  If a reaction fires while the agent is asleep, the reaction's callback function
  will be executed, and the agent will resume sleeping afterwards. The sleep
  timer continues running while the reaction callback function is executing.
  If the sleep time passes while a reaction is executing, the agent will resume
  running after the reaction callback function terminates. </p>
<p>For example, consider the following agent:</p>
<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/sleep_rxn.ma</pre>
<pre class="screen">		pushc 0
		setvar 0		// set heap[0] = 0
		pusht value
		pushc 1
		pushc REACTION
		regrxn			// register reaction
		pushcl 80
		sleep			// sleep for 10 seconds
		getvar 0
		pushc 1			// create tuple containing sum
		pushloc uart_x uart_y
		rout			// send tuple to base station
		getvar 0
		pushc 7
		land
		putled			// display lower 3 bits of sum on LEDs
		halt			// terminate agent

// reaction callback function		
REACTION	inp			// remove tuple from the TS
		pop
		getvar 0
		add
		setvar 0		// heap[0] += value in tuple
		endrxn</pre>
		<p>The agent above sets heap[0] = 0, registers a reaction sensitive to tuples containing a value, and then sleeps for 10 seconds.
		During this time, if a tuple containing a value appears in the local tuple space, the agent will remove the tuple
		using an inp, and then adds the value containing within the tuple to heap[0].  Once the agent finishes sleeping, it creates a tuple containing
		a single value -- the sum of all tuples it reacted to while it was asleep and inserts it into the tuple space on the base station.  
		It then displays the last 3 bits of the sum on the LEDs.</p>
		
		<p>The following agent can be injected while the agent above is asleep.  It simply inserts a tuple containing a single value.</p>
		<pre class="caption">$WUAPPS/AgillaAgents/Tutorials/Lesson4/sleep_out_value.ma</pre>
