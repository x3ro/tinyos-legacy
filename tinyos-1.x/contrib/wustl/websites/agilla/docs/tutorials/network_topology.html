          <h1>Tutorial  Lesson 1 - Customizing the Network Topology</h1>

          <p>Agilla addresses each node by its location rather than its TinyOS

            ID. This is because agents need to know their location to

            correlate sensor readings with the location from which they were

            obtained. Having a sensor reading without its location is not useful.

            For example, if an agent takes a temperature reading and determines

            that

            there

            is

            a

            fire,

            it cannot

            simply tell

            a base

            station

            &quot;fire&quot; but rather &quot;fire at (1,2).&quot; By utilizing a location-centric

            addressing scheme, Agilla provides a unified way of identifying nodes,

            and allows its primitives

            to

            be generalized to operate over regions (e.g., out a tuple into all

            tuple spaces within a particular geographic region). </p>

          <p>Since TinyOS does not provide geographic routing or location discovery,

            the current verion of Agilla utilizes a multi-hop sensor network

            arranged

            in an <em>n</em> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">x</font> <em>m</em> grid.

            Each node is identified by its integer (x,y) location. The lower-left

            corner of the network is location (1,1) and the x and

            y coordinates increase going left and up, respectively. The mote

            connected to the base station has a location of (0,0). Below

            is a 5<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> x</font> 5

            sized network:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="network_setup.JPG" width="350" height="233"></p>

          <p>A multi-hop network is achieved by modifying the TinyOS network

            stack to examine and filter out messages fron non-neighbors. A node

            can only communicate with its imediate neighbors as specified by

            the grid topology. For example, a node located at (2,2) can communicate

            with nodes (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4).</p>

          <p>              To simplify geographic routing, the mote ID relates

            to its location as follows: </p>

          <p align="center"><em>ID = x + (y-1)*(number of columns)</em></p>

          <p>Given the ID, the location can be calculated as follows:</p>

          <p align="center"><em>x = [(ID-1) mod (number of columns)] + 1<br>

  y = (ID &#8211; x)/(number of columns) + 1</em></p>

          <p>For example, in a 4x4 network, the nodes would have the following

            IDs and locations:<br>

              <img src="4x4example.jpg" width="350" height="207"></p>

          <p>The base station is a special case with an ID of 0 and a location

            of (0,0). The base station can interact with any node in the network

            using the build-in geographic routing. Internally, it nodes in the

            first row (x=1). </p>

          <p>To change the size of the network, open <em>&lt;agilla&gt;/types/Agilla.h</em> and

            change the <em>NUM_ROWS</em> and <em>NUM_COLUMNS</em> macros. Once

            you have changed this, you need to recompile Agilla and re-install

            it on all of the motes. Agilla comes with a simple gawk script that

            re-installs Agilla on all of the mote, prompting you to install each

            mote onto the programming board. Use it by going to &lt;agilla&gt; and

            typing <em>gawk -f installer.awk</em>.</p>
