          <h1>Agent Abstraction</h1>

          <p>Agilla is a middleware that enables users to inject mobile

              agents in to a pre-deployed network. Its architcture is shown below.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong><img src="agilla_arch.jpg" width="400" height="217"></strong></p>

          <p>Agilla runs on top of TinyOS, and supports multiple agents per node.

            Each node has a tuplespace that is shared by all agents residing

            on the node, and is accessible by other agents remotely. Agents do

            not communicate directly with each other, but rather through the

            tuplespaces. This ensures each agent remains autonomous and decoupled,

            which simplifies application development. For each node, Agilla performs

            neighbor discovery and maintains a neighbor list that is accessible

            to agents

            residing on the node. Agents can query this list to determine what

            nodes are within range. Pre-2.0 versions of Agilla did not
            use beacons

            for neighbor discovery. They instead assumed the existance of
            the neighbors

            based on the Grid Topology. Agilla 2.0 and beyond use beacons to
            discover neighbors.</p>

          <p>An Agilla agent contains it's own code,

              heap, opstack, and program counter. It is shown below.</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="agent_arch.jpg" width="400" height="179"></p>

          <p>Each agent has a 50 byte stack that is dynamically allocated based

            on the size of the <a href="variables.html">data variables</a>. Note

            that the agent's instructions are not stored within the agent but

            rather is managed within the Agilla middleware.          </p>
