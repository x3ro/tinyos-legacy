<h1>Pre-Packaged Versions of Agilla</h1>
<p>Here are pre-packaged versions of Agilla. See the <a href="../docs/tutorials/getting_started.htm">tutorial</a> for
  installation instructions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>05-13-2007 Version 3.0.3</strong> - <a href="../Agilla_v3.0.3.tar.gz"><strong>Source</strong></a><br>
    Added #if statements around cc2420-specific code, modified the AgentInjector
      to check whether clustering is enabled before it resets the LocationMgr,
      modified some default settings to use relative paths for portability.</li>
  <li><strong>05-22-2006 Version 3.0.2</strong> - <a href="Agilla_v3.0.2.zip">Source</a><br>
  <em>Added an Example Makefile.Agilla and updated the README to describe the flags in it.</em></li>
  <li><strong>05-16-2006 Version 3.0.1</strong> - <a href="Agilla_v3.0.1.zip">Source</a><em><br>
  Contains a small fix that rectifies the &quot;QUEUE_ENQUEUE&quot; error that
      sometimes occurs when there are numerous agents in the network. This distribution
      contains both the Java and NesC code in a single zip file. To install it,
  extract it
  to /opt/tinyos-1.x/.</em></li>
  <li><strong>05-14-2006 Version 3.0</strong> - <a href="Agilla-NesC_v3.0.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v3.0.zip">Java</a><em><br>
  Added support for TelosB platform. Allow the user to disable the grid topology
      filter and greedy routing. Note that the Java Makefile assumes a $AGILLA
      environment variable that specifies the root directory of Agilla's NesC
  code. Agilla's nesC code goes under tinyos-x.1/contrib/wustl/apps/Agilla/.</em></li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>07-14-2005 Version 2.2</strong> - <a href="Agilla-NesC_v2.2.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v2.2.zip">Java</a><em><br>
  Comments: Reduced memory usage to avoid stack overflow when large agents are
      injected.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>05-25-2005 Version 2.1 -</strong> <a href="Agilla-NesC_v2.1.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v2.1.zip">Java</a><br>
        <em>Comments: This version fixes a bug that prevented you from moving
        a mote more than once. It also changes the &quot;reset all&quot; function
        to only reset nodes that are reachable from the base station that broadcasted
        the reset message.</em> </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>05-17-2005 Version 2.0</strong> - <a href="Agilla-NesC_v2.0.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v2.0.zip">Java</a><br>
Comments:<br>
1) The grid size can be changed using the AgentInjector (you no longer have to
reprogram all the motes to change the grid size)
<p><em>2) When specifying the grid size, you only specify the number of columns
    (you no longer need to specify the number of rows). The node&#8217;s TinyOS
    address still determines the mote&#8217;s location. Mote 0 is at (1,1) located
    at the lower-left corner of the grid. TinyOS address&#8217;s increase in
    row major order.</em></p>
<p><em>3) A mote&#8217;s location can be changed using the AgentInjector (you
    no longer need to reprogram the mote to change its address/location). The
    original ID of the mote is always used to specify which mote to modify, e.g., &#8220;move
    mote 1 to location (2,3).&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>4) The AgentInjector enters a modal state for ~3 seconds after a reset
    to allow the network components to reinitialize themselves. This is especially
    critical now that I&#8217;m sending the base station a message immediately
    after it resets telling it that it is a base station.</em></p>
<p><em>5) The nodes periodically broadcast a beacon, neighbor discovery is done
    by each node</em></p>
<p><em>6) The base station can be any node in the network. It no longer has a
    special address. There can be multiple base stations. Base stations can also
    move, their location is set like any other node using the AgentInjector.</em></p>
<p><em>7) Since the location of a base station is no longer known by the non-base
    station nodes, Agilla no longer performs multi-hop routing to (uart_x, uart_y).
    Only the base station can perform a remote tuple space operation to (uart_x,
    uart_y). It is now up to the application to route messages to the base station.
    If an agent knows the location of the base station, Agilla can still perform
    the greedy multi-hop routing to it.</em></p>

  <li><strong>03-30-2005 Version 1.6</strong> - <a href="Agilla-NesC_v1.6.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v1.6.zip">Java</a><em><em><br>
Comments: Fixed a bug in OPcompare preventing comparisons between variables of
      two different types. Now, whenever you try to compare two variables of
      different types, the condition code will always be set to 0.<br>
          <br>
Issues: Linux's timing seems to be different from Windows resulting in agents
being corrupted when injected. To solve this, open &lt;agilla&gt;/types/MigrationMsgs.h,
uncomment lines 63-66, and comment out lines 77-84.</em></em></li>
  <li><strong>03-24-2005 Version 1.5</strong> - <a href="Agilla-NesC_v1.5.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v1.5.zip">Java</a><em><br>
Comments: Fixed a bug preventing agents in the WSN from inserting tuples into
    the laptop's tuple space. Added an Oscilloscope example to demonstrate how
    a Java application running on the laptop can access the laptop's tuple space.</em></li>
  <li><strong>03-23-2005 Version 1.4</strong> <strong> - </strong><a href="Agilla-NesC_v1.4.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v1.4.zip">Java</a><strong></strong><em><strong><br>
  </strong><em>Comments: Fixed the tuple space and modified assembler to report
  line numbers in errors.</em></em></li>
  <li><strong>03-21-2005 Version 1.3 - </strong><a href="Agilla-NesC_v1.3.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v1.3.zip">Java</a><strong><br>
  </strong><em>Comments: This version removes instruction shiftl and shiftr and
  replaces them with mul (multiply) and div (divide). Agents can perform remote
  tuplespace operations on the laptop's tuple space by using location (uart_x,
  uart_y). <br>
    <br>
Issues: The RMI code for allowing remote access to the laptop's tuple space has
not been implemented yet.</em></li>
  <li><strong>11-30-2004
    Version 1.2</strong> - <a href="Agilla_NesC_v1.2.zip">NesC</a>, <a href="Agilla_Java_v1.2.zip">Java</a><br>
      <em>Comments: This is the version used to write the IPSN 2005 SPOTS paper.<br>
                  <br>
      Issues: The pc can access the tuplespace on mote (0,0), but there is no clean
        interface for this yet. The pc cannot register reactions as of yet. The agents
    on the laptop cannot register reactions on tuplespaces within the WSN.</em></li>
