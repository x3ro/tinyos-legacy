          <ul>
            <li> Release date: 05-25-2005</li>
            <li>Download </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li> Fixed a bug that prevented a mote from moving more than once.</li>
            <li> Changes
              the &quot;reset all&quot; function to only reset nodes that are
    reachable from the base station that broadcasted the reset message. </li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h2>Version 2.0</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Release datea: 05-17-2005</li>
            <li>Download </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li> The grid size can be changed using the AgentInjector (you no
            longer have to reprogram all the motes to change the grid size)</li>
            <li>When
              specifying the grid size, you only specify the number of columns
              (you no longer need to specify the number of rows). The
              node&#8217;s TinyOS address
    still determines the mote&#8217;s location. Mote 0 is at (1,1) located at
    the lower-left corner of the grid. TinyOS address&#8217;s increase in row
    major order.</li>
            <li>A mote&#8217;s location can be changed using the AgentInjector
    (you no longer need to reprogram the mote to change its address/location).
    The original ID
    of the mote is always used to specify which mote to modify, e.g., &#8220;move
    mote 1 to location (2,3).&#8221;</li>
            <li> The AgentInjector enters a modal state for
    ~3 seconds after a reset to allow the network components to reinitialize
    themselves. This is especially
    critical
    now that I&#8217;m sending the base station a message immediately after it
    resets telling it that it is a base station.</li>
            <li>The nodes periodically broadcast
      a beacon, neighbor discovery is done by each node</li>
            <li>The base station can be
                any node in the network. It no longer has a special address.
              There can be multiple base stations. Base stations can
        also move,
        their location is set like any other node using the AgentInjector.</li>
            <li>Since
                the location of a base station is no longer known by the non-base
          station nodes, Agilla no longer performs multi-hop routing to (uart_x,
          uart_y). Only the base station can perform a remote tuple space operation
          to (uart_x,
          uart_y). It is now up to the application to route messages to the base
          station. If an agent knows the location of the base station, Agilla
              can still perform
          the greedy multi-hop routing to it. </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Version 1.6</h2>
          <p> * Release date: 03-30-2005<br>
  * Download </p>
          <p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
          <p> 1. Fixed a bug in OPcompare preventing comparisons between variables
            of two different types. Now, whenever you try to compare two variables
            of different types, the condition code will always be set to 0. </p>
          <p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>
          <p> 1. Linux's timing seems to be different from Windows resulting
            in agents being corrupted when injected. To solve this, open &lt;agilla&gt;/types/MigrationMsgs.h,
            uncomment lines 63-66, and comment out lines 77-84. </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Version 1.5</h2>
          <p> * Release date: 03-24-2005<br>
  * Download </p>
          <p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
          <p> 1. Fixed a bug preventing agents in the WSN from inserting tuples
            into the laptop's tuple space. Added an Oscilloscope example to demonstrate
            how a Java application running on the laptop can access the laptop's
            tuple space. </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Version 1.4</h2>
          <p> * Release date: 03-23-2005<br>
  * Download </p>
          <p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
          <p> 1. Fixed the tuple space and modified assembler to report line
            numbers in errors. </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Version 1.3</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Release date: 03-21-2005</li>
            <li>Download </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
          <p> 1. Removes instruction shiftl and shiftr and replaces them with
            mul (multiply) and div (divide). Agents can perform operations on
            the laptop's tuple space by using location (uart_x, uart_y). </p>
          <p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>
          <p> 1. The RMI code for allowing remote access to the laptop's tuple
            space has not been implemented yet. </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Version 1.2
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Release date: 11-30-2004</li>
            <li>Download </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note: </strong>This is the version used to write the IPSN 2005 SPOTS paper.</p>
          <p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li> The PC can access the tuple space on mote (0,0), but there is
              no clean interface for this yet. The PC cannot register reactions.
              The agents on the laptop cannot register reactions on tuple spaces
              within the WSN. </li>
          </ol>
