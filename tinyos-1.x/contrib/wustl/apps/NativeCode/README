Allows a user with a laptop connected to a SN base station to tell motes to toggle their LEDS.   This program does not save the LED status in non-volatile memory.

To run:
- Install ControlLEDs on one or more mica2 motes.
- Install TOSBase on a mica2 on the programming board.  
- Run java program SerialForwarder:
    $java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@COM1:mica2 &
- Run java program ControlLEDs:
    $java ControlLEDs <group id>

ControlLEDs will display three buttons for toggling the three LEDs.

If you are using the NMRD d-sys 25mm mote, be sure to use a baud rate of 19200, 
e.g., $java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@COM1:19200 &
