AGENT GROUP COMMUNICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The group is *not* hard coded in the leader.  To join a group, members query
the base station for the location of the leader.  The base station maintains
a hashtable that maps group name to location of the leader.  It dynamically
injects leaders based on need.  send a "join" message to 
the leader, which records the members in its heap. The leader has a reaction 
sensitive to member broadcast messages.  When this reaction fires, the leader 
sends the value stored within the message to each member.

The members react to the group broadcast message, extract the value and display 
it on the LEDs.

The MemberSend periodically sends the leader a member broadcast message that 
triggers the sending of the group message.
