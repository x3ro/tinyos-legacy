AGENT GROUP COMMUNICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The group is hard coded within the leader to be at locations (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). 
The leader has a reaction sensitive to member broadcast messages.  When this reaction fires,
the leader sends the value stored within the message to each member.

The members react to the group broadcast message, extract the value and display it on the LEDs.

The MemberSend periodically sends the leader a member broadcast message that triggers the 
sending of the group message.

The leader must be at (1,1).
Members must be at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1).
One of the members must be MemberSend.ma.
