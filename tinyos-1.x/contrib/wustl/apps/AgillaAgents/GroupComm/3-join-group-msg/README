AGENT GROUP COMMUNICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The group is *not* hard coded in the leader.  Members send a "join" message to 
the leader, who is assumed to be at (1,1).  The leader has a reaction 
sensitive to member broadcast messages.  When this reaction fires, the leader 
sends the value stored within the message to each member.

The members react to the group broadcast message, extract the value and display 
it on the LEDs.

The MemberSend periodically sends the leader a member broadcast message that 
triggers the sending of the group message.

The leader must be at (1,1).
Members must be at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1).
One of the members must be MemberSend.ma.
Inject the leader first to ensure successful join operation.
