CricketToRF reads cricket data from the serial interface and transmits
the data over wireless.  It is to be used in conjuction with RFToCricket,
which receives the messages and translates them back into a UART ASCII
string.

---- Making the UART baud rate match ---
The Cricket motes set their UART baud rate to be 115.2 kbps.  Mica2 motes
by default use 57.6 kbps.  In order for the two motes to communicate, both
must have the same baud ratings.

How to change Mica2 to 115.2kbps:
  1) Open <tos>/tos/platform/mica2/HPLUART0M.nc
  2) Comment out the two lines following the comment "// Set 57.k KBps".
     They should be:
       //outp(0,UBRR0H); 
       //outp(15, UBRR0L);
  3) Add the following in its place:
       outp(0,UBRR0H); 
       outp(7, UBRR0L);

How to change Cricket motes to run at 57.6kbps:
  1) Open <tos>/tos/platform/cricket/HPLUART0M.nc
  2) Comment out the two lines following the comment "// 115kbps, N-8-1".
     They should be:
       //outp(0,UBRR0H); 
       //outp(7, UBRR0L);
  3) Uncomment the two lines following the comment "// Set 57.6 KBps".
     They should be:
       outp(0,UBRR0H); 
       outp(15, UBRR0L);

-- Installation --
Install CricketToRF on a mote that is connected to the Cricket.
