README for CntToLeds
Author/Contact: Elaine Cheong <celaine @ users.sourceforge.net>

Description:

CntToLeds maintains a counter on a 4Hz timer and displays the lowest
three bits of the counter value. The red LED is the least significant
of the bits, while the yellow is the most significant.  This example
is similar to the example in $TOSROOT/apps/CntToLeds.  However, the
counter data is transferred through a TinyGALS port queue.

Tools:

None.

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
