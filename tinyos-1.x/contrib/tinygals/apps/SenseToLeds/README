README for SenseToLeds
Author/Contact: Elaine Cheong <celaine @ users.sourceforge.net>

Description:

SenseToLeds is an application that periodically samples the photo
sensor and displays the highest 3 bits of the raw ADC light reading to
the LEDs, with RED being the most signficant bit and YELLOW being the
least significant bit.  This example is simlar to the example in
$TOSROOT/apps/SenseToLeds.  It behaves the same as
../SenseToLedsSimple; however, it is built with a separate TimerActor
that triggers SenseActor and DsiplayActor.

Tools:

None
