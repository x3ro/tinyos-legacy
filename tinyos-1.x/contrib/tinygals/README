This directory contains files needed to use the TinyGALS programming
model with existing TinyOS 1.x components written in nesC (.nc) and
TinyGALS actors written in galsC (.gc).  You must first download and
install the galsC compiler from sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/galsc

You must also set the "GALSC" environment variable to point to the top
of the galsC installation directory (which should contain the scripts
and binaries needed to run the galsC compiler).  Alternatively, you
can add the galsC installation subdirectories to your path.  Note that
these paths must come before any existing nesC installations.

The structure of this directory mirrors that of the main TinyOS
distribution.  The "apps" subdirectory contains sample applications
written in the galsC programming language.  The "tos/system"
subdirectory contains the TinyGALS scheduler, which replaces the
original TinyOS scheduler.
