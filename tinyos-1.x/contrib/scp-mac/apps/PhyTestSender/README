1. INTRODUCTION

  This application tests the Physical Layer (PHY) developed at USC/ISI.
The primary component of the physical layer that provides the interface
to upper layer is PHY_RADIO. The mote programmed by this application is a
transmitter that sends packets with different options.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

  A sender will send a group of packets with different configurations,
including packet length (fixed or random), packet interval, and additional
preamble length (fixed or random).

  In the transmitted packets, there is sequence number of the Tx duration 
of the previous transmitted packet.

  Red led toggles when a packet is send. After all packets are sent, all
LEDs are turned on.

3. HOW TO USE

  To use all the default parameters, simply type 'make mica2' and/or 'make
install mica2'.

  To specify different options, look at config.h file for details.

4. NOTES

1) This application is to be used with a receiver part, which is at
apps/PhyTestReceiver/.

2) You can use a snooper (at apps/Snooper/) to see the contents of each packet.
Please note that the sender does NOT clean the memory for each packet. So when
sending variable length packets, a long packet following a short packet will
contain all the payload of the short packet. Don't simply think that packet is
corrupted because of the non-zero payload.
