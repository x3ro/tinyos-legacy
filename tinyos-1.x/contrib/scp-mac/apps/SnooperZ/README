1. INTRODUCTION

   The snooper listens to all packets and sends them to UART. So you can use
   tools/snoop.c to receive and display the packet contents on PC.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

   The snooper streams packets received to the UART. When it is
   connected with the PC through the programming board and the serial
   port, you can display each packet on PC by using
   tools/snoop.c.

3. HOW TO USE

   Simply type 'make micaz' and/or 'make install micaz'.

4. NOTES

   In this version of the Snooper, we include two buffers for
   supporting (some level) of bursty traffic (e.g. packet and
   immediate ack). This is necessary as the radio speed is greater
   than the UART speed and losses will occur.

   Also, because of filtering occuring in the z-physical layer, users
   will not see tones in the snooper (it is a one-line code change in
   PhyRadioM.nc to change this behavior). In addition, for the same
   reason, users will not see failed crc packets on the snooper. The
   PC client snoop program should always be executed with the '-c'
   flag (for disabling crc checking), otherwise all packets will show
   as failing the CRC check (due to the fact that the CC2420 radio
   changes the CRC bytes -- the last 2 bytes in the packet -- removing
   the radio-calculated CRC and substituting those two bytes with RSSI
   and LQI information -- which can be see on the snooper output).
