TOSNIC over SCP-MAC
From Div7wiki

This page describes how to set up and use TOSNIC (the successor to
Hostmote/MoteNIC) with SCP-MAC as the MAC layer. So far this has only
been tested with Mica2 motes.

Basic EmStar Setup

You will first need to do the following (which are not specific to this
application):

    * Download and compile EmStar
    * Download and unpack the latest version of SCP-MAC into a
    * subdirectory of the EmStar tos-contrib directory
    * Insert the fusd.ko kernel module
    * Run fusdd as root 


Compiling SCPBase

SCPBase is the mote-side application which communicates with the TOSNIC
application on the host side. You will find it in I-LENSE CVS under
ilense/tos/commstack/apps/SCPBase. If SCPMAC_ROOT is where you placed
scp-mac in the EmStar tos-contrib directory, then SCPBase will be in
SCPMAC_ROOT/apps/SCPBase.

Currently, due to a bug in SCP-MAC, you will have to perform a small
workaround to get serial communications working properly with
SCPBase. Find the file
SCPMAC_ROOT/tos/platform/mica2/HPLUART0M.nc. Rename this file to
something else (like HPLUART0M.nc.bak). Renaming this file prevents you
from using SCP-MAC UART debugging, but you can't do that an TOSNIC at
the same time anyway - just remember to put it back if you need
something else with UART debugging in the future.

Next, look at the Makefile in SCPMAC_ROOT/apps/SCPBase. Make sure that
SCPMAC_ROOT and TOSNIC_ROOT are pointing to the right directories (they
should be by default). Then, look at the config.h file and modify any
SCP-MAC settings that you wish to customize. Then, simply make mica2,
and make install.<id>, and your mote is ready.

Running TOSNIC

Once you have compiled EmStar, the tosnicd application is found in
emstar/obj.<platform>/mote/. Tosnicd requires the fusd module to be
inserted and fusdd to be running. Run tosnicd (as root or using sudo)
with the following options:

 ./tosnicd --port <device> --tosbase 512 --node_id <id>

where <device> is replaced by the serial port that the mote is attached
to, and <id> is the id that you passed to make install (this can be
omitted if /etc/id exists).

After this is running, the /dev/link/mote devices are available for use
by TOSNIC-aware applications.

Interpreting LEDs

SCPBase toggles the three LEDs for status information:

    * Yellow: Serial communication
    * Green: Radio communication
    * Red: Errors 

If an application attempts to send multiple packets before SCP-MAC has
acquired a schedule, you may see rapid blinking of the red and yellow
lights until the schedule is acquired and the packets are sent. Red LED
errors are usually not fatal - the most common red LED event indicates
that a packet failed to send and will be retried.
