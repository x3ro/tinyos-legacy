README for TimerTest
Author/Contact: weiye@isi.edu

Description:

TimerTest tests the implementation of Timer. The tests also use LocalTime,
the local system time since a node boots, as a reference to verify the timing
accuracy of each timer. Both Timer and LocalTime implementations are based on 
the free-running asynchronous counter. Their implementations support CPU deep
sleep mode, i.e., when there is no interrupts and tasks, the CPU will be put
into deep sleep mode.
