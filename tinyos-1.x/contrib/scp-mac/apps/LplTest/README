1. INTRODUCTION

  This application tests the basic functionality of the low-power listen (LPL)
  MAC. In this MAC nodes randomly polls for channel activity. A sender sends 
  a long preamble before each packet to wake up the receiver.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

  This application used the common implementation in apps/MacTest/, and 
provides wiring and configuration for LPL

3. HOW TO USE

   Suppose you are using 3 motes as the default setting.
   
   1) Compile and install by 'make mica2' and 'make install mica2'.
   2) You can either specify node ID by using 'make install.x mica', 
      where x is the node ID.
   3) Each node first sends 10 broadcast messages, and followed by 10 
      unicast message. The default unicast address for each node is
      - node 1 sends to node 2
      - node 2 sends to node 3
      - node 3 sends to node 1
     This triangle makes sure their transmissions are interfere with each other.
   
   You can specify different parameters and options in the config.h file.
