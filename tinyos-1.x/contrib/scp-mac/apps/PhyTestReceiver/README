1. INTRODUCTION

  This application tests the Physical Layer (PHY) developed at USC/ISI.
The primary component of the physical layer that provides the interface
to upper layer is PHY_RADIO. The mote programmed by this application is a
receiver that counts the number of succesfully received packets and packets
that are received with errors.

  The transmitter part is at apps/PhyTestSender/.

2. FUNCTIONALITY

  The receiver records the following values, and toggle its green LED when 
a packet is successfully received.

* Number start symbol detections
* Number of 'length' (the first field in a packet) errors
* Number of CRC errors
* Number of received packets without any errors

  At the end of the group of packets, the receiver sends out a packet to 
report its above results. This is triggered by a timer, whose delay time
can configured to match the Tx interval on the sender.
   
3. HOW TO USE

  To use all the default parameters, simply type 'make mica2' and/or 'make
install mica2'.

  The following parameters can be defined in the config.h file. If not 
defined, their default values will be used.

  To change different options, please look at config.h for details.   

4. NOTES

1) This application is to be used with a transmitter part, which is at
apps/PhyTestSender/.

2) You can use a snooper (at apps/Snooper/) to see the contents of each packet
sent by the sender as well as the report packet sent by the receiver at the end
of each group.
