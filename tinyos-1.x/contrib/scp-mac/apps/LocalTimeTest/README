README for LocalTimeTest
Author/Contact: weiye@isi.edu

Description:

LocalTimeTest tests the implementation of LocalTime. LocalTime is the local
system time since a node boots. It is based on the asynchronous counter,
which is free running. Time is updated at overflow interrupt. CPU is put
into sleep mode between interrupts.

This test enables the LocalTime component to relay the interrupt signal to the
application. The period to receive the signal is 250ms on Mica-class motes
with ATmega128L. You can also measure timing accuracy by connecting motes with 
an oscilloscope.
