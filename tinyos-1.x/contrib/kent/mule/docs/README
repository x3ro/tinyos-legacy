MULE is a hybrid simulator written by David Watson at Kent State.
It is still very much under development.
For docs and such look at the other files in the docs directory, or online
at http://deneb.cs.kent.edu/mule.

If you try it out, we can probably give you some help, but we can't promise
anything.
