This is an app I wrote to test tiling. Basically, it's a hacked up version of
MULETest. It's designed for a linear topology: nodes 0 and N start out 
broadcasting packets. 0 has its red LED on and N has its yellow LED on.
When a node gets a message from its lower neighbor, it turns on its red LED
and starts sending. From its upper neighbor, turns on yellow LED, starts 
sending. This lets you see as the messages travel up and down the line.

To use tiling, set the HYBRIDTILE environment variable to 'y'. Suppose we have
our hybrid.conf set up for 5 motes in a linear config, and we want to simulate
20 motes. You might do it like this:
$ make pc
	a bunch of output from make......
$ HYBRIDTILE=y HYBRIDCONF=$TOSDIR/hybrid.conf ./build/pc/main.exe 20
