MULEApp:

This is the program that runs on the real motes. Install it on them and
give each one a different ID, or else things may get a little wacky. The
IDs of the real motes do not have to match those of the simulated motes - 
this is all handled.

If you have $TOSDIR set properly, you should be able to just run 
'make mica2', otherwise you'll probably have to edit the makefile.
