MULETest:
This is a combination of CntToRfm and RfmToInt, with a little twist. Each
mote sends out packets at intervals of 50 + 20*NODE_ID milliseconds, counting
up from zero. It keeps track of how many packets it has received from each of
its neighbors, so you can get a feel for how many packets have been lost.
It's only really intended to be used under TOSSIM, because it prints out lots
of debug messages (on channel USR2), and takes up a lot of RAM, since it has
several arrays size 1000. Probably won't even compile for any platform other
than PC.

This is used to test for packet collisions and interference - the timing of 
the messages is such that the motes should try to send at the same time 
fairly often - that's why the times are offset.

If you have your TOSDIR environment variable set properly, you should be 
able to just run 'make pc', otherwise you'll need to hack the makefile.
