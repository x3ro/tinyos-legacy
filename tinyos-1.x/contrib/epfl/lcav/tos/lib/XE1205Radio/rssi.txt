RSSI measurements are read at the following times:

PRE_TX:  before sending, to see if channel is busy.
POST_TX: after sending, to estimate clear channel rssi. 
RX:      during reception, to estimate busy channel rssi.


- PRE_TX takes low range measure, and 'possibly' high range measure.
'possibly' means that "low range measurement saturates low range"


- POST_TX only takes one measure at a time (to minimize the delay till we can
send further packets/ACKs)

- RX takes high range measure, then 'possibly' low range measure, where
  'possibly means that "high range measurement is 0".
