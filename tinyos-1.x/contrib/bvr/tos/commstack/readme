The communication stack used by BVR components

This can also be used by components other than BVR.
It integrates the LinkEstimator, an outgoing queue, and, for the PC side
(TOSSIM), diverts the UART messages to a DBG message of your choice (default
is DBG_USR3).

See doc/html/bvr.html for more details and a diagram.

To use the BVRCommStack in other applications, including those that wish to
use the BVR LinkEstimator, do the following.

In your makefile, add the following flags:

 PFLAGS += -DNO_BVR_INTROSPECT -DNO_LE_LOGGING

In your includes, add the following directories ($(BVR) is the ...contrib/bvr directory):
 -I%T/lib/Queue -I$(BVR)/tos/commstack -I$(BVR)/tos/linkestimator -I$(BVR)/tos/util -I$(BVR)/tos/interfaces

Optionally, you can define the following constants (the number listed below
are the default values):

-DSEND_QUEUE_SIZE=12
-DMAX_QUEUE_RETRANSMITS=5

To use the LinkEstimatorC configuration, you can wire it to some component
that will use it. BVRCommStack (specifically LinkEstimatorComm) has already wired the LinkEstimatorC.StdControl
interface for you.
