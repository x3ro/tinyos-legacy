Todo:
  - finish the code for location database

  - add an application message id to the BVRHeader instead of using the
    payload to do that

  - make the BVRRouter generic (to use different AM types). How to enforce
    that no one will use the reserved AM types?

Status:
  - BVR code released tested on mica2dot motes, working well. Also tested on
    simulator.
