This is beta code for Beacon Vector Routing, v0.5

The BVR algorithm is described in 

  Rodrigo Fonseca, Sylvia Ratnasamy, Jerry Zhao, Chang Tien Ee, David Culler,
  Scott Shenker, and Ion Stoica. "Beacon Vector Routing: Scalable Point-to-point
  routing in Wireless Sensor Networks", in Proceedings of the 2nd Symposium on
  Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI'05), pages 329-342. Boston,
  May 2005.


To read, "install", and use the code, please read 'doc/html/BVR.html'

This is currently research code. I can't guarantee full time support, although
I am willing to help you if you want to use the code! 

Changelog:
   2005/11/18 - Some interesting changes
      - Before routing only worked to (dest_id, coords). Now if you specify
        dest_id to be TOS_BCAST_ADDR, the message is anycast to any node that
        has distance 0 to the dest's coordinates. Can be used to route to
        beacons.
        A test was added for that.
      - Added a parametrized interface to BVRRouter (BVRRouterP). It defines a
        slot parameter that allows multiplexing of different applications on
        BVR routing.
      - Fixed an app_msg_id hack in the BVRRouter code. Now BVRRouter itself
        has a msg_id field that allows for unique identification of the node's
        messages.
   2005/06/15 - Initial checkin into Sourceforge.
      - BVR tested on mica2/mica2dot motes
      - currently assumes sender knows the coordinates of the receiver
      - TODO: finish implementation of the location database
