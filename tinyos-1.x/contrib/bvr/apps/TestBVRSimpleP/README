This app directory differs from TestBVRSimple in that it tests the BVRRouterP
module, which provides a parametrized interface for BVRRouter. This comes at
the cost of a uint8_t extra field in the packet, so may not always be
desirable. Hence the current code duplication between BVRRouter and
BVRRouterP.
