This contrib directory contains an alpha release of TinyDiffusion.
This implementation came about as part of the Extensible Sensing System
(ESS) now deployed at the James Reserve (http://www.jamesreserve.edu) to
enable energy-efficient, taskable, fault-tolerant gathering of
micro-climate data.

More details about this implementation can be found at:

http://www.cens.ucla.edu/~mmysore/Design/

Current installation instructions are being maintained at:

http://www.cens.ucla.edu/~mmysore/Design/OPP/installation-instructions.html

Please contact mmysore AT cens.ucla.edu if you have any
questions/problems/suggestions.

NOTE: 

- The main Services application currently works only on mica2s.  But the
  underlying TinyDiffusion and Neighborlist related modules are independent
  of platform.  

- This software has been developed and used mainly on Linux.  The mote-side
  apps should compile on Cygwin as they do on linux.  The current
  host-side code has linux dependencies (which we are working on removing).
