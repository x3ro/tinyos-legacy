This is a set of tools that run over moted that serve as the 
sink and sink-side applications for a deployment of TinyDiffusion.

So, these can run only on linux.  Installations istructions can be found at
http://www.cens.ucla.edu/~mmysore/Design/OPP/installation-instructions.html

Later versions will include programs that can use GenericBase to
communicate with the sensor nodes.

The current commandline options are minimalistic.  Later versions will have
more flexible and comprehensive options.

For diffsink and diffdump:

-i : used to specify the id of the sink to used to participate in
     TinyDiffusion (for diffsink) or to allow listening in on data packets
     that are destined for the specified sink (for diffdump)

-m : used in conjunction with the -i option so that only packet destined
     for the specified sink id are printed out
