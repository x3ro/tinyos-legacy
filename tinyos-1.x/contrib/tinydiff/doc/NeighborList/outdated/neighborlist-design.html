<h1 align="center">The Neighborlist Functionality: Design Document</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
This document discusses the design of the Neighborlist feature -- essentially,
what it does and how it does what it does.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Purpose of the Neighborlist Functionality</h2>
<br>
This functionality is necessary/important in order to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>allow applications/other modules to query the current list of valid
neighbors</li>
  <li>characterize links and expose these statistics to other modules</li>
  <li>provide a convenient API to allow applications to query these statistics</li>
  <li>optionally, allow applications to filter out "bad" links based on configurable
thresholds.</li>
</ul>
<br>
We'll discuss each of these aspects in the following sections:<br>
<br>
<h2> Link Characterization: Design Considerations</h2>
<br>
In designing this aspect, we were faced with the following considerations/issues/choices.<br>
<ul>
  <li><u>active (beaconing) vs. passive (observing packets already in the
air) </u>approaches to characterizing loss rate with neighbors</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The active approach takes care of periods of low network activity.
&nbsp;Hence, the active ingredient has to be part of the design</li>
    <li>Passive mode is useful because it comes free anyway. &nbsp;In this
approach, each packet is given a per-node sequence number that is incremented
for each packet sent from that node.. &nbsp;Sequence number gaps can then
be used to calculate loss rate. &nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In order to observe all packets (even those not destined to an
observing node), we need to add a module in between two layers of the UC
Berkeley stack -- and this is not "neat". &nbsp;</li>
      <li>If we instead decided to have per-neighbor sequence numbers on
each node, it would probably complicate things more than we want for the
current implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Chosen approach: active approach (beaconing) only. &nbsp;Each node
broacasts special beacon packets which contain sequence numbers. &nbsp;Neighbors
can then calculate loss rate using sequence number gaps.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><u>1 way vs. 2 way loss statistics maintenance</u></li>
  <ul>
    <li>2 way is important because we want to have metrics that would accurately
reflect link asymmetries, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><u>Data structure used to calculate loss rate</u> -- bitmap + end sequence
number (CHOSEN) vs. sequence array :&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>bitmap + end sequence number is preferable keeping in mind memory
constraints</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><u>Strategy used for continuous maintenance of loss rates</u></li>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;EWMA (CHOSEN) vs.&nbsp; simple windowed:&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>EWMA in order to filter out transcients in link quality due to,
say, an animal walking through the pasture.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>API to access the per-neighbor statistics: Design Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to configure parameters involved in loss rate calculation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>desirable if some application wants to have capture loss jitter.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>  this can be done in the init() function for the NeighborBeacon
module</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Single, unified API to access neighbor statistics from any application:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It would be good to provide a single place where this API can be
invoked (more in the next section)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The API provided :<br>
      <br>
command int <b>getNeighbors</b> (uint16_t *nList); // returns # neighbors<br>
command int <b>getNumNeighbors</b> ();<br>
command uint16_t <b>getNextNeighbor </b>(); &nbsp;// enables an interator
on the neighbors in the NeighborStore<br>
      <br>
command <b>getMetric16ForAll</b> (NeighborValue16 *neighbors, uint8_t count,
uint8_t type);<br>
command <b>getNeighborMetric16</b> (uint16_t neighborId, uint8_t type, uint16_t
*pVal);<br>
// similarly for 32 bit metrics<br>
      <br>
command uint8_t <b>getNeighborBlob</b> (uint16_t neighbor, uint8_t type,
uint8_t *buffer, uint8_t *pLength);<br>
      <br>
// set commands are similar<br>
command result_t <b>setNeighborBlob</b> (uint16_t neighbor, uint8_t type,
uint8_t *buffer, uint8_t length);<br>
// and so on...<br>
      <br>
command result_t <b>removeNeighbor</b> (uint16_t neighbor);<br>
      <br>
struct <b>NeighborValue16</b><br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;uint8_t neighborId;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;uint16_t metric;<br>
};<br>
      <br>
struct <b>NeighborValue32</b><br>
 {<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;uint8_t neighborId;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;uint32_t metric;<br>
 }; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Core Modules</h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>NeighborBeacon</b> module :&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Sends out beacons at a specified interval. &nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The format of these beacon packets is as below:<br>
        <pre>+-------------+--------------+-------------+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+------<br>| TOS_Msg ... | sequence no. | incarnation | numRecords | neighbor1 | value 1 | neighbor2 | value 2 | . . .<br>+-------------+--------------+-------------+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+------<br>    7 bytes       2 bytes       1 byte          1 byte      2 bytes   2 bytes    2 bytes    2 bytes<br></pre>
numNeighbors | (neighbor | value)+</li>
      <li>This allows us to pack neighbor records in an unexpanded TOS_Msg
packet.</li>
      <li>For now, the packet format is kept really simple and functional...
but later, if and when we have a need or have a bigger packet size, it can
be expanded to include more metrics.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If all neighbor records do not fit in on beacon packet, they are
rotated and included subsequent beacon packets.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Receives all beacons and incorporates received loss values into the
NeighborStore (see below)</li>
    <li>Calculates loss rates based on gaps in beacon sequence numbers...<br>
    </li>
    <li>Handles ageing of neighbors that haven't responded for a little while<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses a standard AM "port" (type 63, according to msg_types.h) as
any other application</li>
    <li>Stores intermediate values used in loss calculation (bitmap, end
sequence number, incarnation) in a struct that is stored as a "blob" in the
NeighborStore.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>NeighborStore</b> module:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Stores various parameters corresponding to a neighbor</li>
    <li>Supports three types of data:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>16 bit metrics</b>: stored as an array of a predefined size
(which can be 0 if there are no 16 bit metrics)</li>
      <li><b>32 bit metrics</b>: stored as an array of a predefined size
(which can be 0 if there are no 32 bit metrics)</li>
      <li><b>blobs</b>: stored as T-L-V tuples in a buffer of predefined
size; &nbsp;the NeighborStore does not care how long a blob of a particular
type is, as long as there is space to hold it. &nbsp;(the size of this buffer
can be 0, thereby disabling blobs in favor of conserving memory)<br>
        <pre>+--------+----------+----------------+-----------+--------+----------+----------------+------------+<br>| type 1 | length 1 | values 1 . . . |   . . .   | type n | length n | values n . . . | end marker |<br>+--------+----------+----------------+-----------+--------+----------+----------------+------------+<br>  1 byte   1 byte     length 1 bytes               1 byte   1 byte     length n bytes    1 byte<br></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Supports the aforementioned API<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Application Design</h3>
<br>
In our implementation, the customer for the neighborlist functionality is
TinyDiffusion, which assumes that all links that are seen are bidirectional
and "good". &nbsp;Now, one design approach that would keep the TinyDiffusion
code simple by providing it an abstraction of bidirectional and "good" links.
&nbsp;To achieve this, the layered structure, as described below, involving
the NeighborFilter module is provided. &nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>TinyDiffusion uses <b>NeighborFilter</b> as its communication layer</li>
  <li>The NeighborFilter module itself uses GenericComm as its communication
layer</li>
  <li>The NeighborFilter module passes up packes only from "good" neighbors
and sends out packets only to "good" neighbors (this might not be strictly
necessary, but if nothing comes out of sending a packet to a "bad" neighbor,
why waste the energy in doing so?)</li>
  <li>The NeighborFilter module can be configured with two thresholds <b>lowWater</b>
and <b>highWater</b> to implement<br>
   hysterisis on the calculated "bidirectional loss rate" for that neighbor.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>hysterisis is important to prevent high frequence flapping of link
status beween "good" and "bad".<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>bidirectional_loss_rate = in_loss_rate + (1 - in_loss_rate) * out_loss_rate</li>
    <li>implementation of hysterisis needs state regarding whether we are
going "up" (BAD_LINK) or going "down" (GOOD_LINK) ...&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This "good" or "bad" information can be stored in the NeighborStore
module&nbsp;</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Other modules that may benefit from the notion of "good" or "bad"
can use it</li>
        <li>But would perhaps not allow simulataneous existence of multiple
per-application NeighborFilter modules&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>OR, It can be maintained internal to NeighborFilter module in a
table.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows multiple NeighborFilter modules to operate simultaneously</li>
        <li>But consumes more memory</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For now, the former approach is implemented, but going to the latter
(which seems to have its advantages) is a very small change, which should
probably be done.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2><br>
Future Work</h2>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Adding support for promiscuous mode listening to allow computation
of loss rates more frequently: but this will need us to go and insert some
code in between two layers of the Berkeley Communication Stack, which will
need some thinking.</li>
</ul>
