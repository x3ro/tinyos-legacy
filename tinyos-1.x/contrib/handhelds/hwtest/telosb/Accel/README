Testing the Analog Devices ADXL320EB evaluation board.


The Analog Devices ADXL320EB evaluation board has been wired to TelosB
mote using the expansion header.  The ADXL320EB contains a single
ADXL320 two-axis accelerometer.  Connections are as follows:

   Telos B	ADXL320EB
   
   Vcc		Vcc
   Gnd		Gnd
   ADC0		Xout
   ADC1		Yout


The sample code in this directory records data at a flat rate
alternating between the X and Y channels.  The data is available
through the SIPLite streaming interface.
