   This app has multiple uses.
   1. It uses Bluetooth to stream various combinations of data to BioMOBIUS.
   Eg. Accelerometer only, Accel + Gyro data, Accel + ECG data etc.
   It allows the SHIMMER device to be configured and controlled from the BioMOBIUS V2
   SHIMMER block.
  
   2. It can also save data to the micro SD card, though this code
should be deemed unstable.

This application should be used for testing purposes alongside
BioMOBIUS only, as it won't work properly as a stand-along.
Furthermore, it should be used only for testing or quick prototyping,
and not for deployment.

BioMOBIUS V2 is downloadable from http://biomobius.trilcentre.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=27
