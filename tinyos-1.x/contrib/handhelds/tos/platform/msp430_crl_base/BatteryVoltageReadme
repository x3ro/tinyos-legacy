Impt note, we can't seem to have 2 outstanding A/d requests active at
teh same time so we need to round robin them or else they don't
return.

i.e. 

This works:
  event result_t Timer.fired() {
    result_t ok;

    if (NumData%2)
      ok = call ITADC.getData();
    else
      ok = call BVADC.getData();

    return ok;
    
  }

This does not:
  event result_t Timer.fired() {
    result_t ok;

      ok = call ITADC.getData();
      ok = call BVADC.getData();

    return ok;
    
  }
-- 
In the second case whatever I scheduled first returns but the second
does not.
