To add platform FOO_EX

1) add FOO_EX into the file: XXX/tinyos-1.x/tools/make/all.target in
   the PLATFORMS ?= line

2) make a file FOO_EX.target  at teh top have PLATFORM = FOO_EX and at
   the bottom FOO_EX: $(BUILD_DEPS)
		   @:

  -- this is where you define cflags, add platform libraries, etc.

  mwclipboardC is an example of a fullish one:

--- mwclipboardC example start ---
PLATFORM = mwclipboardC

ifdef CC2420_CHANNEL
PFLAGS += -DCC2420_DEF_CHANNEL=$(CC2420_CHANNEL)
endif

CFLAGS += \
-I$(TOSDIR)/lib/CC2420Radio

$(call TOSMake_include_platform,msp)

# for any platform specific libraries
PLATFORM_LIBS = 
PLATFORM_LDFLAGS = 

mwclipboardC: $(BUILD_DEPS)
	@:
