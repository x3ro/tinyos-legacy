ByteStream

This application is designed to test the operation of the handoff process 
among multiple access points. The client will be continuously sending 
packets with unique sequence numbers to a data logging server with a 
fixed IP address through its associated access point. 

The data logging server logs sequence numbers it receives from the 
client. The goal is to prevent data loss caused by movement of 
the client device from the range of one access point to another 
access point.

lib/ contains the adapted code from tos/lib/CC2420Radio to support 
     the handoff process
