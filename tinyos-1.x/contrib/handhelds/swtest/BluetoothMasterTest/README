This master mode is useful when the device only wants to initiate connections (not
receive them). In this mode the device will NOT be discoverable or connectable.

It boots up, initialises the hardware and then connects to a slave and transmits accel and 
gyro data for 30s then disconnects for 30s, this cycles over and over again.

At compile time you need to provide a Bluetooth Slave Address to connect to so do 
"make BT_SLAVE=0011f6057c35 shimmer2" for example....where 0011f6057c35 is your Bluetooth device address

The app uses the BioMOBIUS frame format but just change that to
whatever you need.

SimpleMasterTest does no sampling; it sends a string to the slave
instead of data.  To build this instead of BluetoothMasterTest, just
run 

make -f Make.simple ...etc...

instead.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  after using the bluetooth module in master mode, to return to
slave mode, an application will have to explicitly call 

Bluetooth.setRadioMode(SLAVE_MODE); 

*before* calling BTStdControl.start()
