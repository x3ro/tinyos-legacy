similar to SixAxisTransmitter (with just three axes) this app uses
adc->dma to read the accelerometer; the tcp/ip stack in support of a
telnet server and ntp; the new fat fs, which uses the sd as physical
storage.

commands from the telnet prompt tell it to

- "store" to a particular directory with a running numerical suffix
for each hour of logging; files in each subdir are numbered
sequentially (running uninterrupted for each session for now).
- "conv" at a particular interval in milliseconds, e.g. 20 = 20 ms =
50 hz.
- "stop" stops storage
- "stopconv" halts the adc and dma transfer

file time stamps are localized; if the app is on the network -- it won't do
anything without it, actually -- the times are corrected by ntp every
10 minutes.  without ntp, a time seed should be supplied by the app.
