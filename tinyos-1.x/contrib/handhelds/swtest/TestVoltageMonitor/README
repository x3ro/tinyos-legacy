this samples the voltage monitor muxes to determine the voltage drop
across a calibrated diode inline with the battery supply to determine
a) current battery voltage, and b) momentary current draw by applying
the diode's spec for voltage drop vs. current flow.

we sample the two voltage lines.  the sampled value is measured
against half the 3.0v reference, so to convert to voltage, calculate
its percentage of 12 bits, multiply by two, then multiply by 3.0.

for example, to convert a sampled value of 2700:

2700 / 4095 = 0.65934 * 2.0 * 3.0 = 3.95v

do this for both channels and subtract the two, giving voltage drop
across the diode in the power supply in front of the regulator.
according to the diode spec sheet, knowing the (forward) voltage drop
will tell you the amount of current flowing though the diode, as this
behaviour is non-linear.

the shimmer2r user manual under section 2.4.4 "voltage and power
measurement" provides a more definitive table and discussion.
