this test application does three-port a/d conversion (e.g., from a
three axis accelerometer) and performs a round-robin dma transfer of
the data -- three 256 uint16_t buffers -- to three consecutive sectors
on an sd card on a continuous basis, beginning at an arbitarily set
"current_sector" value.  a tcpserver listens for connections from

remote_client.c is a simple tcp socket client to connect to
TestDMA_SD, send a command-lne provided flash sector number, and pull
the three-axis accelerometer data buffers stored there.
