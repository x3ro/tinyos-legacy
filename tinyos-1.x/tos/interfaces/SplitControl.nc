 * The TinyOS standard control interface. All components that require
 * initialization or can be powered down should provide this
 * interface. start() and stop() are synonymous with powering on and
 * off, when appropriate.
 *
 * On boot, the init() of all wired components must be called. init()
 * may be called multiple times, and in subcomponents before some of
 * their supercomponents (e.g. if they are the subcomponent of
 * multiple components). After init() has been called, start() and
 * stop() may be called multiple times, in any order. The call
 * sequence is therefore:
 *
 * <p>init* (start|stop)*</p>
