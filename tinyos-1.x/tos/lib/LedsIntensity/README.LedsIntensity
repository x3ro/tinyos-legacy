README for LedsIntensity
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu
@author Cory Sharp <cssharp@eecs.berkeley.edu>

Description:

LedsIntensity allows the LED's to display different intensity levels.  The
interface allows the specification of 256 intensities, which may not all
be unique, but which should be nearly-linear: 0 is full-off, 127 is
half-intensity, and 255 is full-on.

Tools:

None.

Known bugs/limitations:

The current implementation maps to 32 linear intensity levels.  It is CPU
intensive while running, constantly posting tasks to produce the
appropriate on/off dithering per LED.
