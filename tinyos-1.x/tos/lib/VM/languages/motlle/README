motlle (MOTe Language for Litlle Extensions) is a scheme-inspired
(dynamically-typed, garbage-collected, first-class functions) scripting
language for Mate, with a very C-like syntax.

At this point, motlle only builds and runs with tossim and on mica2 and
mica2dot motes.

See doc/motlle.txt for an introduction to motlle.

See INSTALL for instructions for configuring motlle for use, building
a simple motlle VM and loading a program (the usual led counting demo).
