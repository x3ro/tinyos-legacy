README for sample VM files

Philip Levis, Feb 16 2004

The files in this directory are sample VM specifications. The
VMBuilder tool, when passed the -nw option, will produce a Mate' 
runtime based on the specification:

java.net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder -nw <filename>

VMSFs (Virtual Machine Specification Files) have five commands. All
commands follow an XML-like syntax; each command begins with a
'<' and ends with a '>'. The first word within the brackets states
which command it is. After the command name are a series of parameters.
The full list of the commands and required parameters is below.


VM
  NAME      The name of the VM
  DESC      Description of the VM
  DIR       Directory to write the VM to

SEARCH
  PATH      Add path to the search path for languages, contexts and primitives.
            Search paths specified earlier in a file are searched first.
            Searches are one-pass; a search path for an item (e.g., context)
            must appear before that item. These entries will also
            be used as compilation flags to the VM.

LANGUAGE
  NAME      The name of the language to use. Must be specified in a
            language description file (.ldf) of that name.

FUNCTION
  NAME      The name of a function to include. Must be specified in an
            opcode description file (.odf).

CONTEXT
  NAME      The name of a context to include. Must be specified in a
            context description file (.cdf).
