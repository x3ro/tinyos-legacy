		  This lesson introduces networking in the Bombilla
		  VM. In it, you'll send raw sensor readings up an
		  ad-hoc collection tree, then use local VM
		  communication to send spatially averaged sensor
		  readings.

		  <b>Introduction</b>
		</TD>
	      </TR>

	      <TR>
		<TD>
		  <p>In lesson 2, you learned the basics of TinyScript
		  programming, including some basic language
		  structure. You also learned how to sample sensor
		  readings, send those readings over the UART, and
		  read them on a PC. In this lesson, you will learn
		  how to route data over a multihop network and how to
		  program motes to communicate with one another.</p>

		  <b>Building a Collection Tree</b>
		</TD>
	      </TR>

	      
	      <TR>
                <TD>

		  <p><b>Note:</b> BombillaLight (for 2KB Teloi) does
		  not support the <b>send</b> function. If you are
		  using Teloi, then you can either skip to the
		  Broadcast handler below, or go through this part of
		  the tutorial with TOSSIM.</p>

		    
		  <p>Bombilla VMs automatically build and maintain an
		  ad-hoc routing tree, which for micas uses the
		  "MintRoute" algorithm implemented in
		  <tt>tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/MintRoute</tt> and for Teloi
		  uses the LQI-based algorithm in
		  <tt>tinyos-1.x/contrib/ucb/tos/lib/MultiHopLQI</tt>. In
		  both, the mote with address zero is the tree
		  collection point, which forwards packets over the
		  UART. To build a routing tree, install Bombilla on a
		  few nodes and plug mote 0 (the base station) into
		  your serial port. It will take a little while (a
		  minute or two) for the nodes to discover one another
		  and build the tree.</p>

		  <p>A mote can route a buffer to the base station
		  with a function that takes a buffer as a
		  parameter. On mica nodes, the function is
		  <tt>send</tt>; on Telos RevB nodes it is
		  <tt>sendlqi</tt> (Telos RevA nodes do not have
		  enough RAM to support collection routing in
		  Mat&eacute;). Running VMBufferReader as in the
		  previous lesson will allow you to see the data the
		  motes route to the base station, which forwards it
		  to the serial port. Stop Timer0 and Timer1, if they
		  are running, with a Once handler. Then install this
		  code as Timer0, and start it with a rate of 1Hz
		  (<tt>setttimer0(10)</tt>):</p>

private i;
buffer buf;

bclear(buf);
for i=0 until bfull(buf)
  buf[] = light();
next i

send(buf)   ! if TelosB, use sendlqi(buf)
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>This program fills a buffer with light readings
		  and sends it. Make sure you sensor boards are
		  attached. You should see output in VMBufferReader
		  like this:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
Received multihop buffer of type PHOTO, size 10 from mote 0
  [131][1023][42][939][669][371][716][527][485][443]
Received multihop buffer of type PHOTO, size 10 from mote 1
  [218][892][538][260][807][183][632][499][710][93]
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>The above readings were generated from TOSSIM
		  with a randomized sensor model: readings from real
		  motes should be much more uniform.</p>

		  <p>Once a mote passes a buffer to the ad-hoc routing
		  subsystem with <tt>send</tt>, all of the routing
		  occurs below the VM, in TinyOS code. If you want to
		  make VMs communicate with one another, you need to
		  use the Broadcast handler, which the next section
		  introduces.

		  <b>Mat&eacute; Networking: The Broadcast Handler</b>
		</TD>
	      </TR>
	      
	      <TR>
                <TD>
		  <p>Bombilla can broadcast a buffer over the radio
		  with the <tt>bcast</tt> function. If Bombilla hears
		  a broadcast packet, it triggers the Broadcast
		  handler, which can retrieve the buffer with the
		  <tt>bcastbuf</tt> function.</p>
		  
		  <p>You can use <tt>bcast</tt> to build a simple
		  combination of the traditional TinyOS apps
		  SenseToRfm and RfmToLeds. This program periodically
		  samples the local sensor and broadcasts it; if it
		  hears a sensor reading, it displays the top three
		  bits on the leds. Write the following handlers and
		  inject them:</p>

		  <table>

buf[]= light();

		  <p>You can use the single-hop communication
		  primitive to locally aggregate sensor readings. The
		  following program periodically sends spatially
		  averaged sensor readings up a routing tree:</p>

			<pre>
shared avg;
shared avgCount;
buffer buf;

if (avgCount > 0) then
  bclear(buf);  
  buf[0] = avgCount;
  buf[1] = avg;
  send(buf);     ! TelosB, use sendlqi()
end if

avg = int(light());
avgCount = 1;
bclear(buf);
buf[] = avg;
bcast(buf);
			</pre>
		      </TD>
		      <TD VALIGN=TOP>
			<pre>
shared avg;
shared avgCount;
buffer received;

received = bcastbuf();
avg = avg + received[0];
avgCount = avgCount + 1;
			</pre>
		      </TD>

		      <TD VALIGN=TOP>
			<pre>
shared avgCount;

avgCount = 0;
settimer0(20);
			</pre>
		      </TD>
		    </TR>
		  </TABLE>
			    
		  <p>The Once context has to set avgCount to 0 for
		  the first time when Timer0 runs; otherwise it will
		  have no type and the comparison (avgCount &gt;
		  0) will throw a type error.</p>
		  
		  <p>This program has variables that several handlers
		  share. The VM automatically schedules the handlers
		  so these variables do not have race conditions. For
		  example, in the above program a race condition could
		  occur if the Broadcast and Timer0 handler were
		  running concurrently. If Timer0 set <tt>avg</tt> to
		  be a single reading, but Broadcast then reads both
		  <tt>avg</tt> and <tt>avgCount</tt>, then it can read
		  the new value for <tt>avg</tt> and the old value for
		  <tt>avgCount</tt>, and produce erroneus values. In
		  this case, the VM won't let the two handlers run
		  concurrently. If a packet arrives while Timer0 is
		  running, the Broadcast handler will wait until
		  Timer0 completes, and if Timer0 fires while
		  Broadcast is running, then Timer0 will wait until
		  Broadcast completes.</p>
