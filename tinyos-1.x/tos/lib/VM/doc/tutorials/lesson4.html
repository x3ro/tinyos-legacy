		  <p>In prior lessons, you used the standard VM that

		  lesson, you will learn how to build a new VM with
		  handlers and functions that meet the needs of a
		  particular application.</p>

	      <TR>
		<TD>
		  <p>So far, you have been using Bombilla, a stock VM
		  that the Mat&eacute; release includes. The
		  Mat&eacute; framework allows you to customize VMs by
		  selecting the set of functions and handlers they
		  support.  By default, Bombilla includes all of the
		  functions and handlers that are part of the standard
		  release . In lesson 2, you may have had to change
		  what sensor board Bombilla supported; this required
		  changing the VM in a very limited way. Knowing how
		  to build VMs will allow you to incorporate additonal
		  handlers or functions that you or someone else
		  writes. The lesson after this one, lesson 5, shows
		  how to write new functions and handlers.</p>

		  <b>The VM Specification File</b>
		</TD>
	      </TR>
	      
	      <TR>
                <TD>
		  <p>In lesson 1, you build Bombilla by running the
		  <tt>VMBuilder</tt> application from the directory
		  <tt>tos/liv/VM/samples</tt>:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <tt>java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder bombilla.vmsf</tt>
		  </quote>
		    
		  <p><tt>bombilla.vmsf</tt> is a VM specification file
		  (vmsf). It tells VMBuilder what handlers, functions,
		  sensorboards and other options to include in the
		  VM. Open <tt>tos/lib/VM/samples/bombilla.vmsf</tt>
		  in an editor. The first line of the file should
		  read:</p>
		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>
&lt;VM NAME="BombillaVM"
 DESC="A simple VM that includes a range of triggering events and functions."
 DIR="../../../../apps/Bombilla"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>This is an example of an <b>element</b>; all
		  Mat&eacute; files (barring nesC code) are sequences
		  of these XML-like elements. The name of an element
		  is the first word after the opening &lt;: the above
		  example is a VM element. Elements have tags, which
		  are key value pairs. The above VM element has three
		  tags, NAME, DESC, and DIR. Element and tag names are
		  case-insensitive; the above could alternatively be
		  written as:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;vm name="BombillaVM"
 DESC="A simple VM that includes a range of triggering events and functions."
 dir="../../../../apps/Bombilla"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>with no change to its meaning. The Mat&eacute;
		  toolchain only recognizes certain elements and
		  tags. Unrecognized tags and elements are
		  ignored. Although the names of the tags are case
		  insensitive, often the values of the tags are case
		  sensitive. For example, changing the case of
		  directory names in the <tt>dir</tt> tag is
		  significant.</p>

		  <p>Every VMSF must have a VM element with a NAME,
		  DESC, and DIR tag. This is so VMBuilder knows what
		  to name files associated with the VM and what
		  directory in which to put them. The Bombilla DIR tag
		  puts the VM in
		  <tt>tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/VM/samples/../../../../apps/Bombilla</tt>,
		  which is <tt>tinyos-1.x/apps/Bombilla</tt>.</p>

		  <p>After the VM element come four SEARCH elements:</p>

		  
		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;SEARCH PATH="../opcodes"&gt;
&lt;SEARCH PATH="../contexts"&gt;
&lt;SEARCH PATH="../languages"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>SEARCH elements tell VMBuilder where to look for
		  files. VMBuilder will search them in the order the
		  file specifies them. PATH tags that have a relative
		  path (like those above) are resolved from <b>where
		  VMBuilder is run</b>, that is,
		  <tt>tos/lib/VM/samples</tt>. PATH tags can also be
		  absolute paths. Every VMSF should have the first
		  three SEARCH elements (opcodes, contexts,
		  languages), which is where all of the standard
		  Mat&eacute; files are.</p>

		  <p>The two lines of the file specify a sensorboard
		  and what language to use (TinyScript). If you're
		  using a Telos mote, it uses MicroScript instead
		  (<tt>microscript</tt>):</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;LOAD FILE="../sensorboards/micasb.vmsf"&gt;
&lt;LANGUAGE NAME="tinyscript"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>The LOAD element tells VMBuilder to load the file
		  specified by the FILE tag and process the elements
		  contained in it. In the above example,
		  <tt>micasb.vmsf</tt> contains elements specifying
		  what functions to support, and where to find the
		  underlying TinyOS components. Using the LOAD
		  element, you can write files containing libraries of
		  functions, for example, which a VM can then include
		  with a single element.</p>

		  <p>The LANGUAGE element tells VMBuilder what
		  language to support. Currently, Mat&eacute; only
		  supports TinyScript, but we're currently working on
		  also suppoting motlle, a scheme-like language. Every
		  VM should have this element, if you want to be able
		  to program with it.</p>

		  <p>A set of FUNCTION elements follows. These
		  describe the set of functions the VM should include
		  and provide to the programmer. For example, Bombilla
		  has several functions for clearing, querying, and
		  sorting buffers:</p>

		
		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;FUNCTION NAME="bclear"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="bfull"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="bsize"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="bufsorta"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="bufsortd"&gt; 
		    </pre>
		  </quote>
		  
		  <p>The NAME tag is the name of the function; it
		  refers to an opcode description file
		  (<tt>.odf</tt>). The ODF file contains information
		  on how many parameters the function takes and their
		  types, whether it has a return value, and a brief
		  description. Lesson 5 details how to introduce new
		  functions by writing ODF files.</p>

		  <p>Finally, after the FUNCTION elements are the
		  CONTEXT elements. These elements specify what
		  software handlers the VM provides: each has its own
		  execution context. Similar to FUNCTION elements,
		  they have a single tag, NAME, which specifies a
		  context description file (<tt>.cdf</tt>) that
		  contains information on the handler. Bombilla
		  includes six handlers:</p>
		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Trigger"&gt;
&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Timer0"&gt;
&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Timer1"&gt;
&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Once"&gt;
&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Reboot"&gt;
&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Broadcast"&gt;
		    </pre>
		  </quote>
		</TD>
	      </TR>

	      
	      <TR BGCOLOR=#80bf80>
                <TD>
		  <b>Building a New VM</b>
		</TD>
	      </TR>
	      
	      <TR>
                <TD>
		  <p>Now that you've seen the Bombilla specification
		  file file, you'll write a description file for a new
		  VM, named SimpleVM. First, open a file named
		  <tt>simple.vmsf</tt> in the <tt>samples</tt>
		  directory. The first line should be a VM
		  element; write the following in the file:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;VM NAME="SimpleVM"
    DESC="A bare bones VM from tutorial 4."
    DIR="../../../../apps/SimpleVM"&gt;
		    </pre>
		  </quote>	  

		  <p>Next, include the standard Mat&eacute; library
		  directories with SEARCH elements, and TinyScript
		  with a LANGUAGE element. If you want to support a
		  sensor board, then also add an appropriate LOAD
		  element. </p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;SEARCH PATH="../opcodes"&gt;
&lt;SEARCH PATH="../contexts"&gt;
&lt;SEARCH PATH="../languages"&gt;
&lt;LANGUAGE NAME="tinyscript"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>If you're using Telos motes, use MicroScript
		  instead of TinyScript. SimpleVM has two handlers,
		  Once and Timer0. Write the following in the
		  file:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Once"&gt;
&lt;CONTEXT NAME="Timer0"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Finally, it supports only a few functions:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>&lt;FUNCTION NAME="rand"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="int"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="sleep"&gt;
&lt;FUNCTION NAME="led"&gt;</pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>Save and close the file. In the <tt>samples</tt>
		  directory, run VMBuilder:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder simple.vmsf
		    </pre>
		  </quote>    

		  <p>Barring any typos in the specification file, this
		  will generate all of the needed VM files in
		  <tt>tinyos-1.x/apps/SimpleVM</tt>. Go to that
		  directory and build the VM for your desired
		  platform. You can install the VM and use the
		  Scripter as you did before with Bombilla. If you use
		  the GUI scripter, you'll see that SimpleVM, in
		  addition to the functions you specified, has
		  <tt>settimer0</tt> as a function. Including Timer0
		  as a context automatically includes
		  <tt>settimer0</tt> as a function.</p>

		  <p>In a VM specification file, the LANGUAGE,
		  CONTEXT, and FUNCTION elements all have a single
		  tag, NAME. All of them tell VMBuilder to look for a
		  description file in the search path. LANGUAGE looks
		  for a language description file (<tt>.ldf</tt>),
		  FUNCTION looks for an operation description file
		  (<tt>.odf</tt>), and CONTEXT looks for a context
		  description file (<tt>.cdf</tt>). VMBuilder reads
		  the file, which contains information on the
		  particular function, context, or language. The file
		  naming is as follows:</p>

		  <br></br>
		  <table>
		    <tr>
		      <td><b>Element</b></td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td><b>Format</b></td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td><b>File Name</b></td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Context</td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td>&lt;CONTEXT NAME=<i>event</i>&gt;</td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td><i>event</i>Context.cdf</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Function</td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td>&lt;FUNCTION NAME=<i>func</i>&gt;</td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td>OP<i>func</i>.odf</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Language</td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td>&lt;LANGUAGE NAME=<i>lang</i>&gt;</td>
                      <td width=20></td>
		      <td><i>lang</i>.ldf</td>
		    </tr>
		  </table>

		  <p>The next two lessons describe how to write new
	      functions and contexts, including their description
	      files. Currently, Mat&eacute; only supports TinyScript
	      and its stripped down variant, MicroScript as languages.</p>

		  <p>
		    There is also a VMBuilder GUI, which you can use
		    to browse available functions and contexts:</p>

		  <quote>
		    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder -gui -t=&lt;lib/VM directory&gt;
		    </pre>
		  </quote>

		  <p>
		    In the above command, the lib/VM directory refers
		    to the path to tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/VM. Specifying
		    this at the command line allows the tool to
		    automatically find ODFs and CDFs. The VMBuilder
		    GUI cannot build VMs; it is only useful as a
		    browsing tool. You should see a GUI like this:</p>
