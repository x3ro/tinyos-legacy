	  In this lesson, you build a provided Mat&eacute;
	  VM and programming environment. You install the VM
	  on a mote (or use TOSSIM) and write a simple program
	  to test that everything is working properly.
	</TD>
      </TR>

      <TR BGCOLOR=#80bf80>
	<TD>
	  <b>Introduction</b>
	</TD>
      </TR>

      <TR>
	<TD>
	  
	  <p>Mat&eacute; has two parts: a Java toolchain and
	  TinyOS components. The Java toolchain resides in the
	  directory</p>
	  
	  <p><tt>tinyos-1.x/tools/java/net/tinyos/script</tt></p>
	      
	  <p>while the TinyOS components reside in</p>

	  <p><tt>tinyos-1.x/tos/lib/VM</tt>.</p>

	  <p>The first thing you need to do is compile the
	  Mat&eacute; toolchain. Go to
	  <tt>tinyos-1.x/tools/java/net/tinyos/script</tt> and
	  type <tt>make</tt>. This should build the two major
	  tools, VMBuilder and Scripter. If you encounter
	  compilation problems, chances are that you haven't
	  properly compiled all the rest of the TinyOS Java
	  packages that Mat&eacute; depends on. These packages
	  include <tt>util</tt>, <tt>packet</tt> and
	  <tt>message</tt>.
	</TD>
      </TR>

      
      <TR BGCOLOR=#80bf80>
	<TD>
	  <b>VMBuilder</b>
	</TD>
      </TR>

      <TR>
	<TD>
	  <p><tt>VM/samples</tt> contains the specification files for
	  several sample VMs, which have the suffix
	  <tt>vmsf</tt>. There are several sample VMs: one for mica
	  platforms (<tt>bombilla-mica.vmsf</tt>), one for Telos revA
	  (<tt>bombilla-telosa.vmsf</tt>), and one for Telos revB
	  motes (<tt>bombilla-telosb.vmsf</tt>). The distinction
	  between the last two is how much RAM they use and hardware
	  details with regards to sensor boards:
	  <tt>bombilla-telosa</tt> is designed to fit in the 2KB of a
	  Telos revA node. The distinction between the mica and Telos
	  VMs lies in the sensors they have.</p>
		    

         <p>Depending on what platform you have, you want to choose
         the appropriate vmsf file. You build a VM with the VMBuilder
         tool; while in the directory <tt>VM/samples</tt>, type</p>

	  <p><tt>java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder <i>file</i></tt></p>

	  <p>This tells VMBuilder to build the VM specified by the
	  file named <i>file</i> (e.g.,
	  <tt>bombilla-telosb.vmsf</tt>). Bombilla is a VM that
	  supports several basic sensor net operations. You should see
	  output similar to this:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>$ java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder bombilla-telosb.vmsf
Currently, filed-based VMBuilder only works from the samples/ subdirectory.
Please be sure you execute it from there.

	  <b>Running Bombilla in TOSSIM</b>
	</TD>
      </TR>

      <TR>
	<TD>

	  <p>To make sure the Mat&eacute; toolchain is working
	  properly, you'll first write programs for TOSSIM
	  motes. TOSSIM only supports mica-class motes, so build
	  bombilla-mica, go to the directory where VMBuilder put it
	  (BombillaMica) and compile it for TOSSIM with <tt>make
	  pc</tt>. You should see a long stream of output, as you
	  build several Java classes, followed by the TOSSIM
	  executable. Set your DBG environment variable to
	  <tt>led</tt>, and run TOSSIM with the following flags:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
./build/pc/main.exe -l=1 -b=1 1
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>This has TOSSIM run in real-time, instead of as
	  quickly as possible (<tt>-l=1</tt>), and makes the
	  node boot in the first second of simulation time
	  (<tt>-b=1</tt>). You should see no output, as the
	  Bombilla VM currently has no code to run.</p>

	</TD>
      </TR>

      <TR BGCOLOR=#80bf80>
	<TD>
	  <b>CntToLeds in Mat&eacute;</b>
	</TD>
      </TR>
      
      <TR>
	<TD>
	  <p>Open a second window and go to the Bombilla
	  application directory. Using your favorite editor,
	  create a file named "reboot.txt" with this code in it:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
led(1);
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>This tells the VM to turn on the red LED. Exit
	  your editor and type this at the command line:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm tossim-serial reboot reboot.txt
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>This runs the TinyScript
	  compiler/scripter. <tt>-comm tossim-serial</tt>
	  tells it to connect to TOSSIM through a virtual
	  serial port to mote 0. <tt>reboot reboot.txt</tt>
	  tells it to inject code that should run when the VM
	  reboots (<tt>Reboot</tt>), and the code is in the
	  file <tt>reboot.txt</tt>. The VM reboots every time
	  it installs new code.</p>

	  <p>All of the tools for interacting with a running
	  VM, such as <tt>Scripter</tt> and
	  <tt>VMBufferReader</tt> (which you'll use later, in
	  Lesson 2), <b>must</b> be executed from the VM's
	  application directory. This is because each VM can
	  have customized message formats and values, and the
	  tools must use the VM-specific versions of those
	  Java classes, which reside in the directory named
	  <tt>vm_specific</tt>.</b>

	  <p>In the TOSSIM window, you should see this output:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
0: LEDS: Red on.
0: LEDS: Green off.
0: LEDS: Yellow off.
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>If you don't see the output, trying running the
	  Scripter again.</p>

	  <p>That program was very simple: it wasn't even
	  Blink. Let's try CntToLeds. This requires writing
	  two scripts: one for what to do when a timer fires
	  (increment a counter and display it), and one to
	  start the timer. Open a file named "timer0.txt" and
	  type:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
private counter;
counter = counter + 1;
led(counter % 8);
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>Every time this program runs, it will increment
	  counter and display its bottom three bits on the
	  mote LEDs (% is the modulo operator). Type</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm tossim-serial timer0 timer0.txt
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>to install the timer script on the VM. However,
	  the timer isn't firing yet; you need to install a
	  script that will start it. Re-open "reboot.txt" and
	  edit it to be</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
settimer0(10);
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>The function <tt>settimer0</tt> controls the rate
	  at which timer0 fires. The parameter is in terms of
	  tenths of a second, so 10 will fire the timer at
	  once a second. Calling it with 0 will stop the
	  timer. When the VM installs the script, it will
	  reboot and run it, starting timer0:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm tossim-serial reboot reboot.txt
	    </pre>
	  </quote>
	  
	  <p>You should see the LED increment in the TOSSIM
	  window. You can also start TinyViz with </p>
	  
	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.sim.SimDriver -gui
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>to see the mote blink visually.</p>

	  <b>Network Programming</b>
	</TD>
      </TR>
      
      <TR>
	<TD>
	  <p>So far, you've been writing scripts for a single
	  simulated mote. Mat&eacute; VMs automatically
	  propagate new programs into a network. Run TOSSIM
	  with four motes:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
./build/pc/main.exe -l=1 -b=1 4
	    </pre>
	  </quote>
	  
	  <p>Write a script that displays mote ID on the
	  LEDs, saving it to "id-led.txt":</p>
	  
	  <quote>
	    <pre>
led(id() % 8);
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>Install it on mote 0 with Scripter:</p>
	  
	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm tossim-serial reboot id-led.txt
	    </pre>
	  </quote>

	  <p>A few moments later, you should see the other
	  motes receive the code and execute it.</p>
	</TD>
      </TR>
      
      
      <TR BGCOLOR=#80bf80>
	<TD>
	  <b>Programming Motes</b>
	</TD>
      </TR>

      <TR>
	<TD>

	  <p>If you have motes, you can repeat all of the above steps
	  using them instead of TOSSIM. If you have Telos motes,
	  you'll need to compile one of the Telos variants. Compile
	  Bombilla for the type of mote you have, and install it as
	  you would any other TinyOS application. Install it on four
	  motes: be sure to give them unique IDs, preferrably
	  sequential (e.g., 9, 10, 11 , 12).</p>

	  <p>Turn on one of the motes and plug it into your
	  serial port or other serial communication
	  device. Start a SerialForwarder for
	  it. SerialForwarder is usually the default
	  communication interface for tools like Scripter.
	  Take the script that displays the bottom three bits
	  of mote ID on the LEDs ("id-led.txt") and install it
	  with Scripter.  You can omit the <tt>-comm</tt>
	  command line parameter:</p>
      
	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter reboot id-led.txt
	    </pre>
	  </quote>
	  
	  <p>If Scripter tries to connect to something besides
	  SerialForwarder, you can tell it to explicitly use
	  SerialForwarder:</p>

	  <quote>
	    <pre>
java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm sf reboot id-led.txt
	    </pre>
	  </quote>
      
      
	  <p>You should see the mote LEDs display the bottom
	  three bits of the mote ID. If you happened to choose
	  a number evenly divisible by eight (e.g., 120), then
	  no LEDs will turn on. Use one of the other
	  motes.</p>

	  <p>Once the script is installed and has run, turn on
	  the other three motes. It may take a few seconds,
	  but they will request the script, download it, and
	  run it themselves, automatically reprogramming. The
	  reason it might take a while is the code propagation
	  algorithm: Mat&eacute; tries to send as few packets
	  as possible (to conserve energy). If it thinks every
	  mote already has the program (as was the case when
	  only one was on), then it slows its code
	  advertisement rate. If things seem to be going too
	  slowly, re-inject the script. This will kick-start
	  the connected mote to advertise more frequently.</p>
