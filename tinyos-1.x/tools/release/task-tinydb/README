Building TASK and TinyDB RPMS requires two steps: generating the source tarball
and building the RPM.  The tarball is built using the extractor script
(in the "release") directory, one level up from this RPM.

You'll need to set up your environment to ensure that RPM can do its
magic.  You may have set up your ".rpmmacros" file already in your
home directory; if not, you should create one and point it at an RPM
working directory.  Let's assume that's /home/madden/rpm.

You're .rpmmacros file will then contain:

%_topdir /home/madden/rpm

You'll need to create the following directories in the
/home/madden/rpm directory:

SOURCES
BUILD
RPMS
RPMS/nodeps

Then, run the extractor script against the tinydb.files file in this
directory; the syntax should be something like:

../extractor <task-tinydb.files ../../.. > /home/madden/rpm/SOURCES/task-tinydb-1.1.0.tar.gz

Now, you should be able to build the RPM with the command:

rpmbuild -bb tinydb.spec

Which will create the RPM file in /home/madden/rpm/RPMS/nodeps
