The SimDriver / TinyViz code is still rather fresh. Be warned, your
mileage may vary. This is a (likely incomplete) list of things that I
know need to be done and plan to do in the near future.

- fix bug in RadioModelGuiPlugin where it doesn't reflect the scripted
  changes

- pause callbacks to optionally take an event parameter

- do the jarfile packaging

- link up slider with simulation rate
