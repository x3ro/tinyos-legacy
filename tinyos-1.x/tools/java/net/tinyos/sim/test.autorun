# This is an example of a TinyViz autorun configuration file.
# Lines are of the form: <key> <value>
# Keys may not have embedded whitespace.
#
# The file contains one or more stanzas, where each stanza is separated
# by a blank line. Each stanza defines parameters for a single
# simulation run. Stanzas inherit settings from the previous stanza.
#
# Possible keys are:
#   executable  - Full pathname of TOSSIM executable         (REQUIRED)
#   nummotes    - Number of motes                            (REQUIRED)
#   dbg         - Setting for DBG environment variable
#   logfile     - File to log all events for later processing
#   numsec      - Number of virtual seconds to simulate
#   stopstring  - If a debug message contains this string, stop simulation
#   stopmode    - What to do when the simulation finishes. 
#                 Valid settings are "exit" (kill simulation and
#                 continue with next run) or "pause" (pause simulation
#                 and quit when user resumes manually).
#   plugin      - Give class name of plugin to register during run
#     All plugins containing this name will be registered. Plugins
#     operate normally during the run and can visualize, collect data, 
#     and actuate the simulation.
#
#   All other lines on the file are interpreted as "name value" pairs
#   that are set as plugin options inside of TinyViz. Plugins receive
#   these options as a series of OptionSetEvent events. Options can also
#   be queried using TinyViz.getOption(). Essentially this allows
#   plugins to "hook into" this configuration file by receiving
