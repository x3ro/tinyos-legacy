This is the Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) library.  DTN is a project
aimed at providing a store-and-forward overlay for applications
to communicate over networks that may suffer from frequent
(and in some cases predictable) partitions.

This library is a portion of a larger system including a DTN
forwarding agent.  The rest of the system, along with a description
of the overall project, is available at http://www.dtnrg.org.

The agent and the library do not need to be co-resident on the
same machine, but they will probably work best if they are
(at least for the time being).

Both the library and agent have been built and used under
Linux, both for Intel StrongARM as well as Intel x86.

Please see the documents at the web site listed above,
the bundle_common.x file, and the sample applications for more details.
