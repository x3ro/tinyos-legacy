Package: net.tinyos.sf.old
Description: provides serial port multiplexing
Author: Bret Hull <bwhull@uclink4.berkeley.edu>

This application instantiates a server which provides
a bi-directional packet stream between a mote connected
to the host PC and clients anywhere on the network.  For 
more information, see "serialforwarder.pdf" in the "doc"
directory.  Run from the nest "tools" directory. To add
a new data source, simply implement the interface defined
in DataSource.java and modify SerialForward.java 
accordingly.


Executables: none

Program: SerialForwarder

net.tinyos.SerialForwarder.SerialForward
        usage: java net.tinyos.SerialForwarder.SerialForward
        descr: main SerialForwarder application

Classes:

ClientServicer.java

Handles the connection between a given client and the server.
