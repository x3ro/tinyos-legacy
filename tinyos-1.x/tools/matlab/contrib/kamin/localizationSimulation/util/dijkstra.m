% Solving the Shortest Path Problem using Dijkstra's Algorithm 
% - This function takes in a square matrix as input. The matrix 
% represents the weights of edges in a network of n vertices. A zero 
% indicates that vertices are not adjacent. The function returns 
% an n-1 x 3 matrix, sp, that shows the shortest total path length 
% to each vertex from the starting vertex (in the middle column), 
% and the preceding vertex in the minimum path (in the right column). 
% 
% DIJKSTRA find the shortest paths from the starting vertex to 
% each other vertex in the network. 
% 
% INPUT: 
% A = input matrix 
% 
% OUTPUT:
% sp = shortest paths to each vertex from starting vertex
