This tool will collect RSSI data from a bunch on Mica2 or Dot3 nodes.

To do this, first install tinyos-1.x/apps/chipconRSSI application on several nodes, which should be numbered 1-n in sequential order.

Then, make sure you have a generic base on your serial port.

finally, run the startCollectingRSSI.m file in matlab and then the initalizeChipconRSSI.m file.  For example, if your nodes are numbered 1-16, type

startCollectingRSSI;
initializeChipconRSSI(1:16, 1:16, mIF);


and you should start seeing matlab try to make each node chirp in turn and then collect the sampled RSSI values from each receiver.
