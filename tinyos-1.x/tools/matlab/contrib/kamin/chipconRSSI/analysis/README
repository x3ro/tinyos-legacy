
run the matlab script analyzeRSSI.m and you will see 6 graphs pop up.  They are from 3 data sets, as follows:

1. a 3 x 8 grid with 3 meter spacing outdoors in the grass
2. a 4 x 4 grid with 3 meter spacing outdoors in the grass
3. a 3 x 5 grid with 2 meter spacing indoors in a lab setting

The antennas and nodes were placed completely randomly. 

the first graph for each node is simply the distribution of distance estimates over true distance.

The second graph will be the histograms of error.
