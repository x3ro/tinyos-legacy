To install the TinyOS CVS tree from sourceforge, assuming you have already
installed the TinyOS 1.1 distribution, do the following:


- Remove your tinyos tree from the installation (if you've made changes,
save these somewhere first!):

  rpm -e tinyos

- Check tinyos out from the sourceforge CVS repository:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tinyos login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tinyos co tinyos-1.x

- If you use bash, copy the tinyos-1.x/tools/scripts/tinyos.sh.in to
  /etc/profile.d/tinyos.sh, and edit it to contain the correct value for 
  TOSROOT (this assumes your setup runs the scripts in /etc/profile.d, if not, 
  place the contents of tinyos.sh in your shell startup scripts)

  If you use tcsh, edit your startup scripts to do the same things as tinyos.sh
  does for bash.

  From here on, work in new shells to get your new environment

- If the tinyos-1.x tree has new tools, you can compile and install them by
  doing:
  cd $TOSROOT
  make
  make install # (as root on Linux)

- Compile the java code:
  cd $TOSROOT/tools/java
  make
