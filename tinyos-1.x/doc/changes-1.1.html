<p> This document outlines the major changes that have occured in TinyOS
since the last release (1.0) and the current release (1.1). These
changes include the replacement of <tt>net.tinyos.sf.SerialForward</tt>
with <tt>net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder</tt> (along with major changes to
how java programs send and receive packets, and an improved UART
protocol), compile-time race condition detection in nesC, support for
the mica2 platform and Chipcon radio, power management, AM-level
cryptography for integrity and confidentiality (TinySec), network
reprogrammming, ad-hoc routing, and support for new mote programmers in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">uisp</span>. Systems packaged with
1.0, such as TinyDB and Mat&eacute;, also have many advancements.
As with the <a href="changes-1.0.html">transition</a> from 0.6 to 1.0,
there are many small changes such as bug fixes. This document only
describes these major changes which every user should be aware of.</p>

<p><code>net.tinyos.sf.SerialForward</code> has been replaced 	by <code>net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder</code>.The
new SerialForwarder will normally be used with the GenericBase
replacement, TOSBase (see the TinyOS section). The old serial forwarder
is still available, at <span style="font-family: monospace;">net.tinyos.sf.old.SerialForward</span>.
As part of this     transition a new package, <code>net.tinyos.packet</code>,
provides standardized access to many different packet sources,
ranging from <span style="font-family: monospace;">SerialForwarder</span>
to TOSSIM to a serial port. Packet     sources are specified by string
descriptions: running <code>net.tinyos.packet.BuildSource</code>
provides a list of all     of the available sources. The new framework
provides the following advantages:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new UART protocol provides reliable PC-mote communication
(and preserves the destination address of received packets...).</li>
  <li>The new protocols are packet-size independent, so you should no
longer need to specify packet sizes in your java applications or in the
serial forwarder.</li>
  <li>TOSBase sets the group id on outgoing messages, and filters
incoming messages by group id. Thus most java programs do not need to
know the group id <span style="font-family: monospace;">(net.tinyos.packet</span>,
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">net.tinyos.message</span>
when used with the new packet sources, do not check or set group ids).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Java applications can more easily connect to a variety of packet
sources (see the next paragraph).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Most programs (except <span style="font-family: monospace;">SerialForwarder</span>
itself) read the <span style="font-family: monospace;">MOTECOM</span>
environment variable to find which packet source they should use, and if <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">MOTECOM</span> is not defined will
connect to a <span style="font-family: monospace;">SerialForwarder</span>
on the local host. <br>
</p>
<p>In summary:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can still use the old GenericBase, along with
net.tinyos.sf.old.SerialForward, and leave your current java code
unchanged.</li>
  <li>You can switch to TOSBase (which provides reliable PC-mote
communication), and change your java code to use the new packet sources.
The necessary changes are extremely minor, especially if you were using <a
 href="nesc/mig.html"><span style="font-family: monospace;">mig</span></a>
and the <span style="font-family: monospace;">net.tinyos.message</span>
package.</li>
  <li>GenericComm uses the new UART protocol, so if you were connecting
your PC directly to your mote application (i.e., not using GenericBase),
you will have to switch to the new packet sources on the PC side.</li>
</ul>
More information on the UART protocol, on packet sources and the
associated java packages can be found <a

<p>nesC now supports and checks the TinyOS concurrency model. It
makes a distinction between <b>asynchronous</b> code, which can
execute in interrupt context, and <b>synchronous</b> code, which can
only execute in tasks. The boot sequence is considered a task (as
it runs synchronously). Essentially, sync (synchronous) code     is
non-preemptive; it runs to completion with respect to other     sync
code. async code, however, can preempt itself and sync     code.</p>
<p>This means that if a variable is read or written in async code,
there is a possible race condition; it can preempt a concurrent
access. Variables that can be modified by async code must be
protected by atomic sections, which ensure atomic access. This is an
example of a state transition that is safe, even in the     presence of
async code:</p>
<code></code>
<pre>    bool oldBusy;<br>    atomic {<br>      oldBusy = busy;<br>      busy = TRUE;<br>    }<br>    if (!oldBusy) {<br>    ...<br>    </pre>
<p>nesC wiring allows interfaces to "fan-out;" a single <code>uses</code>
can be wired to more than one <code>provides</code> and vice-versa. A
single call point calls     multiple functions: this raises the
question of what the return     value of the call means.</p>
<p>In nesc 1.0, the return value from a fan-out was that of one of
the functions, randomly determined at compile-time. nesC 1.1
introduces the idea of a "combine function," which is associated
with a type. For example, the combine function for <code>result_t</code>
returns <code>FAIL</code> if any of its     values to combine are <code>FAIL</code>.
If calling <code>StdControl.init</code> fails on one of the callees,
the     caller should see so.</p>
<p>Some types do not have combine functions; for example <code>TOS_MsgPtr</code>
does not. Calling two functions, both of     which return a pointer, has
unclear semantics, and is almost     certainly a bug. In the case of <code>ReceiveMsg.receive()</code>,
for example, which of the two buffers should be used?</p>
<p>nesC 1.0 had a <code>unique</code> function, to use with
parameterized interfaces. However, some parameterized interfaces had
fixed ranges that were smaller than their parameterization
suggested (e.g., <code>TimerC</code> had 16 timers, but a <code>uint8_t</code>
parameterization); using more would fail,     using fewer wasted
storage. nesC 1.1 has a new function, <code>uniqueCount</code>, which
is resolved at compile time. Like <code>unique</code>, it takes a
string parameter. For example, <code>uniqueCount("Timer")</code> will
return the number of calls     to <code>unique("Timer")</code>.</p>
<p>nesC 1.1 includes a new tool, <a href="nesc/ncg.html"><code>ncg</code></a>,
or "nesC     Constant Generator. ncg can take a <code>.h</code> file,
read all     of the constants defined, and generate a Java class that
provides those constants. This means that constants no longer have to be
replicated across TinyOS code and the associated Java tools.</p>

 href="nesc/ref.pdf">nesC Reference Manual</a>.</p>

<p>TinyOS 1.1 supports the mica2 and mica2dot platforms, including a <a
 href="">Chipcon-based active message networking stack</a>. It     also
supports the mica platform, with its RFM-based networking     stack. It
no longer support the rene platform.</p>
<p>The directory structure of TinyOS has been changed slightly;     the <code>lib</code>
subdirectory now only contains directories     representing add-on
systems.</p>
<p>TinyOS 1.1 provides a <a href="multihop/multihop_routing.html">many-to-one
collection     oriented ad-hoc routing system</a>, which has been
tested and     evaluated both in controlled and deployment conditions
(e.g., Great Duck Island). The routing system is in <code>lib/Route</code>.</p>
<p>TinyOS 1.1 includes support for single-hop binary reprogramming
over the network. This system, <a href="Xnp.pdf">Xnp</a>, was
developed by <a href="http://www.xbow.com">Crossbow</a> and     refined
by the TinyOS team. Xnp is in <code>lib/Xnp</code>. There     are
several example applications that use it: <code>XnpCount</code>, <code>XnpOscopeRF</code>
and <code>XnpRfmToLeds</code>. The Java tools are in <code>net.tinyos.xnp</code>.</p>
<p>TinyOS 1.1 has mechanisms for run-time power management.</p>
<p>GenericBase has been replaced by TOSBase. TOSBase provides the
same functionality as GenericBase, but uses an improved serial
communication protocol. GenericBase had no framing besides message
size, and therefore failed when bytes transmitted to it were     lost.
TOSBase uses a framing protocol. Correspondingly, old     applications
tha talk to a serial port may not communicate with     TOSBase.
Additionally, GenericBase filtered     outgoing messages based on group
ID; TOSBase instead sets the     group ID of all packets sent out on the
radio. This means that     Java-side tools do not need to know the
group ID used in the     network. For special applications, the
TransparentBase application behaves like TOSBase except that it does not
set the group id on outgoing messages or filter incoming messages by
group id (leaving these tasks to the Java tools).<br>
</p>
<p><a href="tossim.pdf">TOSSIM</a> has been extended and     refined.
Its command line syntax has changed slightly. It now     supports a
lossy networking model, and there is a Java tool to     generate loss
topologies based on empirical data gathered from a     mica network.
TOSSIM 1.1 does not simulate the mica2 networking     stack, instead,
continues to support the mica RFM stack. TOSSIM     does not support the
new non-volatile storage interfaces yet     (described below).</p>
<p>TOSSIM now includes TinyViz, a Java application that can
visualize and actuate running simulations. TinyViz has an extensible
"plugin" interface, so users can write new     visualization plugins
and load them into the TinyViz     infrastructure.</p>
<p>TinyOS 1.1 has improved support for accessing non-volatile     flash
memory, through the <code>ByteEEPROM</code> region-based and <a
 href="matchbox.pdf"><code>Matchbox</code></a> file system based
interfaces. <span style="font-family: monospace;">Matchbox</span> is in <code>lib/FS</code>.
There is also support for high-frequency sampling; depending on the
platform and other factors, 3-5kHz ADC sampling to the flash (for later
retrieval) is possible. This is found in <code>apps/HighFrequencySampling</code>.</p>
<p><a href="tinysec.pdf">TinySec</a>, a networking stack that
includes cryptographic integrity and confidentiality, is included in <code>lib/TinySec</code>.</p>
<p>The ADC component (<code>ADCM</code>) now provides fair-share
access to different ports. It handles outstanding requests in a
round-robin fashion, preventing one high-frequency sampler from
dominating all others. There is also an alternative ADC
implementation, <code>ADCRef</code>, which produces values taken in
reference to the system voltage (since ADC readings depend on this).</p>
<p><code>sendVarLenPacket</code> has been removed from
GenericComm. Since the UART now uses a framing protocol, this
functionality is not longer feasible.</p>
	
<p>Using nesC's concurrency support, many TinyOS components have
been modified or rewritten to remove race conditions. System
services should be correspondingly more stable.</p>

<p>nesC now includes support for <a href="nesc/debugging.html">on-mote
debugging</a> using JTAG.</p>
<p><a href="mcenter.html" style="font-family: monospace;">MessageCenter</a>,
developed by     Vanderbilt, is now part of the standard TinyOS
toolchain. <span style="font-family: monospace;">MessageCenter</span>
has several subtools. One allows you to     dynamically specify packet
formats for reception and     transmission. MessageInjector, a TinyOS
1.0 that loads all MIG     generated message classes into a GUI for
setting fields and     transmitting, has been incorporated into <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">MessageCenter</span>. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">MessageCenter</span> is in the Java
package <code>net.tinyos.mcenter</code>.</p>
<p>The Chipcon radio has a wide range of available     frequencies. The
tool <a href="mica2radio/CC1000.html"><code>channelgen</code></a>,
given a desired     frequency, provides the corresponding values to set
the radio at.<br>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">uisp</span> tool now
supports the new serial-based programming board (mib510) and
ethernet-based reprogramming (EPRB). Additionally, the standard <a
 href="../apps/Makerules"><span style="font-family: monospace;">Makerules</span></a>
file can be told to invoke uisp with appropriate parameters for these
various programming boards, as explained <a
