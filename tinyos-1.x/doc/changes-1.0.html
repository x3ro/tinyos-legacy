Significant Changes in TinyOS between v0.6 and 1.0b</big></big></b>

<p> This document outlines the major changes that have occured in
TinyOS since the last release (0.6.1) and the current release (1.0
beta). These changes include the use of a new language, an improved
networking stack, greatly increased documentation, and the inclusion
of several large systems. There are many small changes (bug fixes,
etc.), but the following describes these major changes which every user should 
be aware of.</p>

</tr></table></p>

    <p>TinyOS components used to be written in a highly decorated
    version of C, using preprocessor macros; TinyOS 1.0b uses a new
    C-like language, nesC (network-embedded-systems-C). The 1.0b
    release includes the nesC compiler (ncc) as well as a language
    reference and language transition help documents.</p>

    <p>nesC has several advantages to older TinyOS code, such as
    interfaces, wire error detection, automatic document
    generation, and facilitation of significant code optimizations over
    previous TinyOS builds. One of its major goals is to make TinyOS
    code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to write.</p>

    <p>The TinyOS tutorials now provide an introduction to nesC and
    its syntactic constructions.</p>

</tr></table></p>

    <p>The 40Kb mica networking stack has several added
    features. These include data-link level synchronous
    acknowledgements, variable length packets, and a rough estimate of
    network activity. An in-depth description of the workings of the
    stack is provided in the documentation directory /doc. 
    The modified <code>TOS_Msg</code> structure is as follows:</p>

    
<pre><code>
typedef struct TOS_Msg {
  uint16_t addr;
  uint8_t type;
  uint8_t group;
  uint8_t length;
  int8_t data[TOSH_DATA_LENGTH];
  uint16_t crc;
  uint16_t strength;
  uint8_t ack;
  uint16_t time;
} TOS_Msg;
</code></pre>

    <p>The message send interface has also changed to include a
    length parameter, which specifies how much data is in the data
    field.</p>
      
    <p>The networking stack does not forward CRC values for packets.
    Instead, the crc field is set to 0 or 1 to denote whether the
    packet passed the check; the default networking stack discards all
    packets that fail CRC checks.</p>
      
    <p>The <code>ack</code> field is only meaningful on packet
    sends. If the field is 1, then the mote received an explicit
    link-level acknowledgement from a receiver. In the case of
    broadcast messages, <code>ack</tt> will be set to 1 if one or more
    motes received the message. These acknowledgements are synchronous
    and take roughly the same amount of time as transmitting one
    byte.</p>

    <p><code>ncc</code>, the nesC compiler, can automatically generate
    documentation for TinyOS components. Typing <code>make
    &lt;platform&gt; docs</code> in an application directory will
    build HTML docs for each component and interface (as well as build
    the application). These documents are placed in
    <code>doc/nesdoc</code> and the top-level application document is
    symlinked in the application directory.</p>

    <p>TinyOS 1.0b includes two large systems as examples of complex
    TinyOS applications. The first, Bombilla, is a bytecode
    interpreter for simple application programming. The second,
    TinyDB, is a tiny database engine for routing queries to and data
    from a network. Both have PC tools. Bombilla has tools for writing
    and injecting assembly-style programs, while TinyDB has tools for
    writing SQL-like queries and displaying the results. Documentation
    for both systems exists in the <code>doc/</code> directory.</p>
