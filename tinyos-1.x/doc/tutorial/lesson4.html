<p>This lesson introduces two concepts: hierarchical decomposition of
component graphs, and using radio communication. The applications that
we will consider are <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> and <tt>RfmToLeds</tt>. <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt>
is a variant of <tt>Blink</tt> that outputs the current counter value to
multiple output interfaces: both the LEDs, and the radio communication
stack. <tt>RfmToLeds</tt> receives data from the radio and displays it
on the LEDs. Programming one mote with <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt> will
cause it to transmit its counter value over the radio; programming
another with <tt>RfmToLeds</tt> causes it to display the received
counter on its LEDs - your first distributed application!<br>
</p>
<p>If you're using mica2 or mica2dot motes, you will need to ensure
that you've selected a radio frequency compatible with your motes
(433MHz vs 916MHz motes). If your motes are unlabeled, see "<a
 href="../mica2radio/mica2freq.html">How to determine the operating
frequency range of a MICA2 or MICA2DOT mote</a>" for information on
recognizing which kind of mote you have. To tell the compiler which
frequency you are using, edit the <a href="buildenv.html">Makelocal</a>
file in the apps directory, defining either <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">CC1K_DEF</span><span style="font-family: monospace">_PRESET</span> (see <a
 href="../../tos/platform/mica2/CC1000Const.h">tinyos-1.x/tos/platform/mica2/CC1000Const.h</a>
for preset values), or <span style="font-family: monospace;">CC1K_DEF_FREQ</span> 
with an explicit frequency
(see example in <a
 href="file:///home/dgay/motes/tinyos-1.x/doc/tutorial/buildenv.html">Makelocal</a>).<br>

<p>The first thing to note is that a single interface requirement (such
as <tt>Main.StdControl</tt> or <tt>Counter.IntOutput</tt>) can be <i>fanned
out</i> to multiple implementations. Here we wire <tt>Main.StdControl</tt>
to the <tt>Counter</tt>, <tt>IntToLeds</tt>, <tt>IntToRfm</tt>, and <tt>TimerC</tt>components.
(All of these components can be found in the <tt><a
 href="../../tos/lib/Counters">tos/lib/Counters</a></tt> directory.) The
names of the various components tell you what they do: <tt>Counter</tt>
receives <tt>Timer.fired()</tt> events to maintain a counter. <tt>IntToLeds</tt>
and <tt>IntToRfm</tt> provide the <tt>IntOutput</tt> interface, that has
one command, <tt>output()</tt>, which is called with a 16-bit value,
and one event, <tt>outputComplete()</tt>, which is called with <tt>result_t</tt>
. <tt>IntToLeds</tt> displays the lower three bits of its value on the
LEDs, and <tt>IntToRfm</tt> broadcasts the 16-bit value over the radio. </p>
<p>So we're wiring the <tt>Counter.Timer</tt> interface to <tt>TimerC.Timer</tt>,
and <tt>Counter.IntOutput</tt> to <b>both</b> <tt>IntToLeds</tt> and <tt>IntToRfm</tt>.
The NesC compiler generates code so that all invocations of the <tt>Counter.IntOutput.output()</tt>
command will invoke the command in both <tt>IntToLeds</tt> and <tt>IntToRfm</tt>.
Also note that the wiring arrow can go in either direction: the arrow
always points <i>from</i> a used interface <i>to</i> a provided
implementation. </p>
<p>Assuming you are using a Mica mote, try building and installing this
application with <tt>make mica install</tt>; you should see a 3-bit
binary counter on the mote's LEDs. Of course the mote is also
transmitting the value over the radio, which we describe next. <br>

<tt>IntToRfm</tt> is a simple component that receives an output value
(through the <tt>IntOutput</tt> interface) and broadcasts it over the
radio. Radio communication in TinyOS follows the Active Message (AM)
model, in which each packet on the network specifies a <i>handler ID</i>
that will be invoked on recipient nodes. Think of the handler ID as an
integer or "port number" that is carried in the header of the message.
When a message is received, the receive event associated with that
handler ID is signaled. Different motes can associate different receive
events with the same handler ID. </p>
<p>In any messaging layer, there are 5 aspects involved in successful
communication: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Specifying the message data to send;</li>
  <li> Specifying which node is to receive the message;</li>
  <li> Determining when the memory associated with the outgoing message
can be reused;</li>
  <li> Buffering the incoming message; and,</li>
  <li> Processing the message on reception</li>
</ol>
In Tiny Active Messages, memory management is very constrained as you
would expect from a small-scale embedded environment.
<p>Let's look at <tt>IntToRfm.nc</tt>: </p>

<p>This component provides the <tt>IntOutput</tt> and <tt>StdControl</tt>
interfaces. This is the first time that we have seen a <i>configuration</i>
provide an <i>interface</i>. In the previous lessons we have always
used configurations just to wire other components together; in this
case, the <tt>IntToRfm</tt> configuration is itself a component that
another configuration can wire to. Got it? </p>
<p>In the implementation section, we see: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; components IntToRfmM, GenericComm as Comm;</pre>
The phrase "<tt>GenericComm as Comm</tt>" is stating that this
configuration uses the <tt>GenericComm</tt> component, but gives it the
(local) name <tt>Comm</tt>. The idea here is that you can easily swap
in a different communication module in place of <tt>GenericComm</tt>,
and only need to change this one line to do so; you don't need to
change every line that wires to <tt>Comm</tt>.
<p>We also see some new syntax here in the lines: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; IntOutput = IntToRfmM;<br>&nbsp; StdControl = IntToRfmM;</pre>
The equal sign (<tt>=</tt>) is used to indicate that the <tt>IntOutput</tt>
interface provided by <tt>IntToRfm</tt> is<b> "equivalent to"</b> the
implementation in <tt>IntToRfmM</tt>. We can't use the arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>)
here, because the arrow is used to wire a used interface to a provided
implementation. In this case we are "equating" the interfaces provided
by <tt>IntToRfm</tt> with the implementation found in <tt>IntToRfmM</tt>.
<p>The last two lines of the configuration are: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; IntToRfmM.Send -&gt; Comm.SendMsg[AM_INTMSG];<br>&nbsp; IntToRfmM.StdControl -&gt; Comm;</pre>
The last line is simple; we're wiring <tt>IntToRfmM.StdControl</tt> to <tt>GenericComm.StdControl</tt>.
The first line shows us another use of <b>parameterized interfaces</b>,
in this case, wiring up the <tt>Send</tt> interface of <tt>IntToRfmM</tt>
to the <tt>SendMsg</tt> interface provided by <tt>Comm</tt>.
<p>The <tt>GenericComm</tt> component declares: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; provides {</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface SendMsg[uint8_t id];</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp; }</pre>
In other words, it provides 256 different instances of the <tt>SendMsg</tt>
interface, one for each <tt>uint8_t</tt> value. This is the way that
Active Message handler IDs are wired together. In <tt>IntToRfm</tt>,
we are wiring the <tt>SendMsg</tt> interface corresponding to the
handler ID <tt>AM_INTMSG</tt> to <tt>GenericComm.SendMsg</tt>. (<tt>AM_INTMSG</tt>
is a global value defined in <tt><a
 href="../../tos/lib/Counters/IntMsg.h">tos/lib/Counters/IntMsg.h</a></tt>.)
When the <tt>SendMsg</tt> command is invoked, the handler ID is
provided to it, essentially as an extra argument. You can see how this
works by looking at <tt>tos/system/AMStandard.nc</tt> (the
implementation module for <tt>GenericComm</tt>):
<pre>&nbsp; command result_t SendMsg.send[uint8_t id]( ... ) { ... };</pre>
Of course, parameterized interfaces aren't strictly necessary here -
the same thing could be accomplished if <tt>SendMsg.send</tt> took the
handler ID as an argument. This is just an example of the use of
parameterized interfaces in nesC. <br>

<p>Now we know how <tt>IntToRfm</tt> is wired up, but we don't know how
message communication is implemented. Take a look at the <tt>IntOutput.output()</tt>
command in <tt>IntToRfmM.nc</tt>: </p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

</center>
<p>The command is using a message structure called <tt>IntMsg</tt>,
declared in <tt>tos/lib/Counters/IntMsg.h</tt>. It is a simple struct
with <tt>val</tt> and <tt>src</tt> fields; the first being the data
value and the second being the message's source address. We assign
these two fields (using the global constant <tt>TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS</tt>
for the local source address) and call <tt>Send.send()</tt> with the
destination address (<tt>TOS_BCAST_ADDR</tt> is the radio broadcast
address), the message size, and the message data. </p>
<p>The "raw" message data structure used by <tt>SendMsg.send()</tt> is <tt>struct
TOS_Msg</tt>, declared in <tt>tos/system/AM.h</tt>. It contains fields
for the destination address, message type (the AM handler ID), length,
payload, etc. The maximum payload size is <tt>TOSH_DATA_LENGTH</tt> and
is set to 29 by default; you are welcome to experiment with larger data
packets but some nontrivial hacking of the code may be required :-) Here
we are encapsulating an <tt>IntMsg</tt> within the data payload field of
the <tt>TOS_Msg</tt> structure. </p>
<p>The <tt>SendMsg.send()</tt> command is split-phase; it signals the <tt>SendMsg.sendDone()</tt>
event when the message transmission has completed. If <tt>send()</tt>
succeeds, the message is queued for transmission, and if it fails, the
messaging component was unable to accept the message. </p>
<p>TinyOS Active Message buffers follow a strict alternating ownership
protocol to avoid expensive memory management, while still allowing
concurrent operation. If the message layer accepts the <tt>send()</tt>
command, it owns the send buffer and the requesting component should not
modify the buffer until the send is complete (as indicated by the <tt>sendDone()</tt>
event). </p>
<p><tt>IntToRfmM</tt> uses a <tt>pending</tt> flag to keep track of the
status of the buffer. If the previous message is still being sent, we
cannot modify the buffer, so we drop the <tt>output()</tt> operation
and return <tt>FAIL</tt>. If the send buffer is available, we can fill
in the buffer and send a message. <br>

</p>
<p>Recall that <tt>IntToRfm</tt>'s <tt>SendMsg</tt> interface is wired
to <tt>GenericComm</tt>, a "generic" TinyOS network stack
implementation (found in <tt>tos/system/GenericComm.nc</tt>). If you
look at the <tt>GenricComm.nc</tt>, you'll see that it makes use of a
number of low-level interfaces to implement communication: <tt>AMStandard</tt>
to implement Active Message sending and reception, <tt>UARTNoCRCPacket</tt>
to communicate over the mote's serial port, <tt>RadioCRCPacket</tt> to
communicate over the radio, and so forth. You don't need to understand
all of the details of these modules but you should be able to follow
the <tt>GenericComm.nc</tt> wiring configuration by now. </p>
<p>If you're really curious, check out <tt>AMStandard.nc</tt> for some
details on how the ActiveMessage layer is built. For example, it
implements <tt>SendMsg.send()</tt> by posting a task to take the
message buffer and send it over the serial port (if the destination
address is <tt>TOS_UART_ADDR</tt> or the radio radio (if the
destination is anything else). You can dig down through the various
layers of code until you see the mechanism that actually transmits a
byte over the radio or UART.

</p>
<p>The <tt>RfmToLeds</tt> application is defined by a simple
configuration that uses the <tt>RfmToInt</tt> component to receive a
message, and the <tt>IntToLeds</tt> component to display the received
value on the LEDs. Like <tt>IntToRfm</tt>, the <tt>RfmToInt</tt>
component uses <tt>GenericComm</tt> to receive messages. Most of <tt>RfmToInt.nc</tt>
should be familiar to you by now, but look at the line: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; RfmToIntM.ReceiveIntMsg -&gt; GenericComm.ReceiveMsg[AM_INTMSG];</pre>
This is how we specify that Active Messages received with the <tt>AM_INTMSG</tt>
handler ID should be wired to the <tt>RfmToIntM.ReceiveMsg</tt>
interface. The direction of the arrow might be a little confusing here.
The <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt> interface (found in <tt>tos/interfaces/ReceiveMsg.nc</tt>)<b>only</b>
declares an event: <tt>receive()</tt>, which is signaled with a pointer
to the received message. So <tt>RfmToIntM</tt> <i>uses</i> the <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt>
interface, although that interface does not have any commands to call --
just an event that can be signaled.
<p>Memory management for incoming messages is inherently dynamic. A
message arrives and fills a buffer, and the Active Message layer
decodes the handler type and dispatches it. The buffer is handed to the
application component (through the <tt>ReceiveMsg.receive()</tt>
event), but, critically, <b>the application component must return a
pointer to a buffer upon completion</b>. </p>

</center>
<p>Note that the last line returns the original message buffer, since
the application is done with it. If your component needs to save the
message contents for later use, it needs to copy the message to a new
buffer, or return a new (free) message buffer for use by the network
stack.

<p>TinyOS messages contain a "group ID" in the header, which allows
multiple distinct groups of motes to share the same radio channel. If
you have multiple groups of motes in your lab, you should set the
group ID to a unique 8-bit value to avoid receiving messages for other
groups. The default group ID is <tt>0x7D</tt>. You can set the group
ID by defining the preprocessor symbol <tt>DEFAULT_LOCAL_GROUP</tt>.</p>
<pre>&nbsp; DEFAULT_LOCAL_GROUP = 0x42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # for example...</pre>
<p>Use the <tt><a href="buildenv.html">Makelocal</a></tt> file to set
the group ID for all your applications.</p>
<p>In addition, the message header carries a 16-bit destination node address. 
Each communicating node within a group is given a unique address assigned at 
compile time.&nbsp; Two common reserved destination addresses we've introduced 
thus far are <tt>TOS_BCAST_ADDR (0xfff)</tt> to broadcast to all nodes or <tt>TOS_UART_ADDR 
(0x007e)</tt> to send to the serial port. </p>
<p>The node address may be any value EXCEPT the two reserved values described 
above.&nbsp; To specify the local address of your mote, use the following 
install syntax: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; make mica install.&lt;addr&gt;</pre>
where <i>&lt;addr&gt;</i> is the local node ID that you wish to program
into the mote.&nbsp; For example,
<pre>&nbsp; make mica install.38</pre>
compiles the application for a mica and programs the mote with ID 38. Read
