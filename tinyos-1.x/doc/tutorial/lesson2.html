<p>This lesson demonstrates a simple sensor application that takes light
intensity readings (from the sensor board's photo sensor on Mica motes or
from the onboard temperature sensor on Telos) and displays
those readings on the LEDs. This is based on the <tt>Sense</tt> application,
found in <tt><a href="../../apps/Sense">apps/Sense</a></tt>. This is a
very simple application that reads a value from the light sensor and displays
the lower 3 bits of the value on the LEDs. The application configuration
is found in
<tt>Sense.nc</tt> and the implementation module in <tt>SenseM.nc</tt>.

<p>Let's first look at the top portion of <tt>SenseM.nc</tt>:
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">

<pre>module SenseM {
&nbsp; provides {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface StdControl;
&nbsp; }
&nbsp; uses {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface Timer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface ADC;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface StdControl as ADCControl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface Leds;
&nbsp; }
}
// Implementation not shown ...</pre>
</td>

</table></center>

<p>Like <tt>BlinkM</tt>, this component provides the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface and uses <tt>Timer</tt> and <tt>Leds</tt>. It also uses two more
interfaces: <tt>ADC</tt>, which is used to access data from the analogue-to-digital
converter, and <tt>StdControl</tt>, which is used to initialize the ADC
component.
<p>This application uses a new component, <tt>TimerC</tt>, in place of
<tt>SingleTimer</tt>.
The reason is that <tt>TimerC</tt> allows multiple instance of timers,
while <tt>SingleTimer</tt> only provides a single one that only one component
can use. We'll discuss more on <tt>Timer</tt> a bit later.
<p>Note the line
<pre>&nbsp; interface StdControl as ADCControl;</pre>
This is saying that this component uses the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface
but gives the <b>interface instance</b> the name
<tt>ADCControl</tt>. In
this way a component can require multiple instances of the same interface,
but give them different names. For example, a component might need to use
the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface to control both the ADC and the sounder
components. In this case we might say:
<pre>&nbsp; interface StdControl as ADCControl;
&nbsp; interface StdControl as SounderControl;</pre>
The configuration that uses this module will be responsible for wiring
each interface instance to some actual implementation.
<p>One related note: if you don't provide an interface instance name then
the instance is named the same as the interface. That is, the line
<pre>&nbsp; interface ADC;</pre>
is just shorthand for
<pre>&nbsp; interface ADC as ADC;</pre>
Take a look at the <tt>StdControl</tt> and <tt>ADC</tt> interfaces (both
in tos/interfaces). You'll see that
<tt><a href="../../tos/interfaces/StdControl.nc">StdControl</a></tt>
is used to initialize and power a component (usually a piece of physical
hardware) and <tt><a href="../../tos/interfaces/ADC.nc">ADC</a></tt> is
used to get data from an ADC channel. <tt>ADC</tt> signals an event, <tt>dataReady()</tt>,
when data is ready on the channel. Notice the <b>async</b> keyword is used
in the ADC interface. This is declaring the commands and events as asynchronous
code, i.e., code which can run in response to a hardware interrupt.
<p>Open the file <tt><a href="../../apps/Sense/SenseM.nc">apps/Sense/SenseM.nc</a></tt>.&nbsp;
You'll see the code simply calls
<tt>ADC.getData()</tt> each time
<tt>Timer.fired()</tt>
is signaled. Likewise, when <tt>ADC.dataReady()</tt> is signaled, the
internal function <tt>display()</tt> is invoked, which sets the LEDs to
the low-order bits of the ADC value.
<p>Notice the use of the function <tt>rcombine()</tt> in the implementation
of <tt>StdControl.init()</tt>.
<pre>&nbsp; return rcombine(call ADCControl.init(), call Leds.init());</pre>
The function <tt>rcombine()</tt> is a special nesC combining function which
returns the logical-and of two commands who result type is result_t.

<p>At this point you should be wondering, "how does the <tt>Sense</tt>
application know that the ADC channel should access the light sensor?"
This is exactly what the <tt>Sense.nc</tt> configuration wires up for us.
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >

&nbsp; SenseM.Leds -> LedsC;
&nbsp; SenseM.Timer -> TimerC.Timer[unique("Timer")];
}</pre>
</td>

</table></center>

<p>Most of this should be familiar from <tt>Blink</tt>. We're wiring up
the
<tt>Main.StdControl</tt> to <tt>SenseM.StdControl</tt>, as before.
The
<tt>Leds</tt> wirings is also similar to <tt>Blink</tt>, and we'll
discuss
<tt>Timer</tt> in a minute. The wiring for the ADC is:
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADC -> Sensor;
&nbsp; SenseM.ADCControl -> Sensor;</pre>
All we're doing is wiring up the <tt>ADC</tt> interface (used by
<tt>SenseM</tt>)
to a new component called <tt>DemoSensorC</tt>. Same goes for the <tt>ADCControl</tt>
interface, which you'll recall is an instance of the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface used by
<tt>SenseM</tt>.
<p>Remember that
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADC -> Sensor;</pre>
is just shorthand for
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADC -> Sensor.ADC;</pre>
On the other hand,
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADControl -> Sensor;</pre>
is <b>not shorthand</b> for
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADC -> Sensor.ADCControl;</pre>
What's going on here? If you look at the <tt>DemoSensorC.nc</tt> component (found
in
<tt>tos/sensorboards/micasb</tt>), you'll see that it provides both
the <tt>ADC</tt> and <tt>StdControl</tt> interfaces -- it doesn't have
an interface called <tt>ADCControl</tt>. (<tt>ADCControl</tt> was just
the name that we gave to the instance of
<tt>StdControl</tt> in the <tt>SenseM</tt>
component.) Rather, the nesC compiler is smart enough to figure out that
because <tt>SenseM.ADCControl</tt> is <i>an instance of</i> the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface, that it needs to be wired up to
<i>an instance of</i> the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface provided by <tt>DemoSensorC</tt>. (If <tt>DemoSensorC</tt> were to provide
two instances of
<tt>StdControl</tt>, this would be an error because the
wiring would be ambiguous.) In other words,
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADControl -> Sensor;</pre>
is shorthand for
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.ADControl -> Sensor.StdControl;</pre>
Whew!
<br>&nbsp;

interfaces</font></nobr></b></td>

</table>

<p>Let's look at the line
<pre>&nbsp; SenseM.Timer -> TimerC.Timer[unique("Timer")];</pre>
This is introducing a new bit of syntax, called a <b>parameterized interface</b>.
<p>A parameterized interface allows a component to provide
<i>multiple
instances</i> of an interface that are parameterized by a runtime or compile-time
value. Recall that it's possible for a component to provide multiple instances
of an interface and to give them different names, e.g.,
<pre>&nbsp; provides {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface StdControl as fooControl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface StdControl as barControl;
&nbsp; }</pre>
This is just a generalization of the same idea. The <tt>TimerC</tt> component
declares:
<pre>&nbsp; provides interface Timer[uint8_t id];</pre>
In other words, it provides 256 different instances of the
<tt>Timer</tt>
interface, one for each <tt>uint8_t</tt> value!
<p>In this case, we want TinyOS applications to create and use multiple
timers, each of which can be managed independently. For example, an application
component might need one timer to fire at a certain rate (say, once per
second) to gather sensor readings, while another component might need the
a timer to fire at a different rate to manage radio transmission. By wiring
the <tt>Timer</tt> interface in each of these components to a separate
instance of the <tt>Timer</tt> interface provided by <tt>TimerC</tt>, each
component can effectively get its own "private" timer.
<p>When we say <tt>TimerC.Timer[someval]</tt>, we are specifying that
<tt>BlinkM.Timer</tt>
should be wired to the instance of the
<tt>Timer</tt> interface specified
by the value (<tt>someval</tt>) in the square brackets. This can be any
8-bit positive number. If we were to specify a particular value here, such
as 38 or 42, we might accidentally conflict with the timer being used by
another component (if that component used the same value in the brackets).
So, we use the compile-time constant function <tt>unique()</tt>, which
generates a unique 8-bit identifier from the string given as an argument.
Here,
<pre>&nbsp; unique("Timer")</pre>
generates a unique 8-bit number from a set corresponding to the string
<tt>"Timer"</tt>.
Therefore, Every component that uses <tt>unique("Timer")</tt> is guaranteed
to get a <i>different</i> 8-bit value as long as the string used in the
argument is the same. Note that if one component uses <tt>unique("Timer")</tt>
and another uses
<tt>unique("MyTimer")</tt>, they might get the <i>same</i>
8-bit value. Therefore it's good practice to use the name of the parameterized
interface as an argument to the <tt>unique()</tt> function. The compile-time
constant function<tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; uniqueCount("Timer")</tt>
<p>will count the number of uses of <tt>unique("Timer"</tt>).

<p>As before, just do a <tt>make mica install</tt> in the <tt>Sense</tt>
directory to compile and install the application on your mote. 
For Mica motes, you'll need
a sensor board attached to the mote with a photo sensor. The Mica sensor
board, for example, snaps into place via the 51 pin connector. The type
of sensorboard is selected by the <tt>-board</tt> command line option to
<tt>ncc</tt>.
On the Mica mote, the default sensor board type is <tt>micasb</tt>. However,
if you have an older ("basic") sensor board, you might need to pass in
the <tt>-board basicsb</tt> option to <tt>ncc</tt>. To do this, edit the
<tt><a href="../../apps/Sense/Makefile">Makefile</a></tt>
in the
<tt>Sense</tt> directory and add the line
<tt>SENSORBOARD=basicsb
</tt>before
the line that includes <tt>Makerules</tt>. The sensor boards supported
by TinyOS are represented by the directory names in <a href="../../tos/sensorboards">tos/sensorboards</a>.
If you are using Telos motes, the temperature sensor is built into the
microcontroller and doesn't require a sensorboard or the <tt>-board</tt>
command line option.  

<p>The operation of the sensor is a bit unusual. The ADC yields a
10-bit digitized sample of the photo sensor. What we would like is for
the LEDs to be off when the node is in the light, and on when the node
is in the dark. Here, we are looking at the upper three bits of this data
coming from the ADC, and inverting the value. Note the line:
<pre>&nbsp; display(7 - ((data >> 7) &amp; 0x7));</pre>
in the <tt>ADC.dataReady()</tt> function of <tt>SenseM</tt>.
<p>Note that when running the application you may really have to cover
up the photo sensor pretty well to get it to respond - we'll admit that
this is not the best application to really see the photo sensor at work!

<p>
<b>For Mica motes:</b>
Extend the capability of the application by chirping the sensor board's
sounder when it is dark! The TinyOS component for the Sounder is located
in <tt>tos/sensorboards/micasb/Sounder.nc</tt> and provides the
<tt>StdControl</tt>
interface. Modify <tt>SenseM.nc</tt> to add a
<tt>StdControl</tt> as <tt>SounderControl</tt>,
wiring it as appropriate in <tt>Sense.nc</tt>.&nbsp; Remember to call init()
to initialize the Sounder component. To make the sounder turn on from SenseM.nc,
call
<tt>SounderControl.start()</tt>. To turn off the sounder, call
<tt>SounderControl.stop()</tt>.
Be sure to test this new application many times to annoy everyone sitting
around you.
