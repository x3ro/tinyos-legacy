    <p>Mat&eacute; allows users to program TinyOS networks with short,
    high level event handler scripts. Users install a virtual machine
    TinyOS application on motes, and a Java application compiles
    scripts to the VM bytecodes. These bytecodes run in a sandboxed VM
    environment, so buggy programs cannot crash a mote. Event handlers
    have version numbers, and motes automatically install new versions
    they hear. Once a single copy of a newer program is installed, the
    network will automatically propagate it to every node.</p>

    <p>Mat&eacute; simplifies programming by providing a synchronous
    interface to TinyOS operations. For example, the
    <code>send()</code> function blocks until the underlying
    <code>sendDone</code> event is handled by TinyOS. This makes code
    much less complex, especially for novice programmers. Currently,
    Mat&eacute; programs are written in a simple, BASIC-like scripting
    language called TinyScript. We are working on making the
    architecture flexible enough for alternative scripting language
    options.</p>
      
    <p>As the core of Mat&eacute; is a virtual machine, it also
    provides a form of execution protection. Unlike TinyOS
    applications, which have no user/kernel boundary, Mat&eacute;
    programs cannot crash a mote or render it
    unresponsive. Mat&eacute; catches errors at run time
    (e.g. accessing an invalid heap variable) and has a mechanism for
    alerting a user to them (all the LEDs blink and it sends a
    message), including simple debugging information on the code that
    caused the error.</p>
	
    <p>Mat&eacute; has an event-based execution model; pieces of code
    are run in response to events, such as a timer or a packet
    reception. The presence of blocking operations requires that event
    handlers be able to run in parallel; the presence of shared
    variables could make race conditions a significant
    problem. Mat&eacute; handles this issue by having handlers
    implicitly lock all shared resources they use; the set of shared
    resources used is computed with a full program analysis when code
    is installed. Therefore, a programmer can write several
    Mat&eacute; event handlers that share variables and be sure there
    will be no race conditions without having to consider the
    necessary synchronization.</p>

    <p>Mat&eacute; allows users to build customized virtual machines
    for specific application deployments. However, it also has two
    simple example VMs which you can build and use.</p>

    <p>Mat&eacute;'s code resides in two directories. The first,
    <code>tools/java/net/tinyos/script</code> is the Java toolchain
    for building VMs and writing scripts. The second,
    <code>tos/lib/VM</code>, is the actual VM TinyOS code.</p>

    <p>The first step to using Mat&eacute; is to build the Java
    toolchain. Go to <code>tools/java/net/tinyos/script</code> and
    type <code>make</code>. This builds the two principal tools,
    VMBuilder and Scripter, as well as all of their supporting code
    (parsers, etc.).</p>

    <p>Once you've built the toolchain, the next step is to build a
    Mat&eacute; VM and associated scripting environment. Go to
    <code>tos/lib/VM/samples</code>. You should see two files:
    <code>bombilla.vmsf</code> and <code>simple.vmsf</code>. These
    files describe VMs. Build Bombilla by typing:

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>

$ java net.tinyos.script.VMBuilder -nw bombilla.vmsf

	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>

      You <b>must</b> do this from the <code>samples</code>
      directory. You should see output similar to this:

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">

 	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>
    </p>

    <p>Running <code>VMBuilder</code> on this file creates an
    application in <code>tinyos-1.x/apps/Bombilla</code>. There should
    be four files: <code>Makefile</code>,
    <code>MateConstants.h</code>, <code>MateTopLevel.nc</code> and
    <code>vm.vmdf</code>.</p>

    <p>Go there and type <code>make pc</code>. Running make should
    create a new directory, <code>vm_specific</code>, which contains
    several Java classes for the Bombilla VM, as well as build a
    TOSSIM version of the VM. You can correspondingly <code>make
    mica2</code> for mica2 nodes. Note that every time you build a
    Mat&eacute; executable, <code>make</code> regenerates the Java
    files. Correspondingly, <code>make reinstall.num</code> can be
    useful.</p>
    
    <p>Build Bombilla for the hardware that you have. Install the VM
    on a single node, with ID 0 (<code>make reinstall.0</code>). Plug
    that mote into your serial port. Then, from the Bombilla
    directory, type

      
      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>

$ java net.tinyos.script.Scripter -comm serial

 	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>
    </p>

    If you aren't using a serial port, or have some specific options
    you need (e.g., <code>-comm serial@COM2</code> or <code>-comm
    sf</code>), change the parameter correspondingly.</p>

    <p>This will load a Scripter interface for Bombilla. It should
      look something like this:</p>
    
    <p>
      <center><IMG SRC="imgs/bombilla.jpg"><br>
      <b>The Scripter Interface</b></center>
    </p>
    
    <p>This is the interface for writing scripts to install on a
      Mat&eacute; network.</p>
    
    <p>
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">

		<font face="arial,helvetica">The Scripter Interface</font>
	      </b></td> </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>The Scripter interface is broken into three major parts. We'll
    step through each of them, one by one.</p>

    <p>The left panel has two fields, Mote ID and Version Number. In
    Mote ID you should enter the ID of the mote at the end of the
    serial port; in this case, it's 0, so you don't need to change
    anything. You generally do not need to change the Version Number
    field; the interface will take care of that for you. However,
    sometimes you need to manually change it. For now, leave it
    alone.</p>

    <p>
      <center><IMG SRC="imgs/bombilla-left.jpg"><br>
      <b>The Left Scripter Panel</b></center>
    </p>
    
    <p>Below the two fields is a selection for which event handler you
    which to program. The Bombilla VM has two event handlers: Once and
    Timer0. The Once event handler runs once, when new code is
    installed. Timer0 runs periodically at some frequency. By default,
    it is disabled. Other VMs can handle different events than these,
    such as packet reception, target detection, or processing
    requests. Bombilla is a simple one, however, so only has these
    two.</p>

    <p>Below the selection is an area called <b>Shared
    Variables</b>. As a later section shows, scripts can declare
    variables that are shared across scripts. This area displays all
    of the shared variables currently in use. For now, it's empty. To
      the right of this display is the <b>Inject</b> button, and a
      greyed-out button, which you can ignore. Inject is used to
    introduce a new program to a network.</p>
    
     <p>
      <center><IMG SRC="imgs/bombilla-center.jpg"><br>
      <b>The Center Scripter Panel</b></center>
    </p>

    <p>The center panel has a single area, <b>Program Text</b>. This
    is where you write TinyScript code to compile and install in a
    network.</p>

      
    <p>
      <center><IMG SRC="imgs/bombilla-right.jpg"><br>
      <b>The Right Scripter Panel</b></center>
    </p>

    
    <p>The right panel has two areas. On top is a list of
    <b>Primitives</b>. These are functions, beyond general TinyScript
    operations, that scripts can call. Selecting one of them brings up
    a brief description in the lower panel.</p>

    <p>When you quit Scripter, you should always do so through the
    <b>File</b> menu. Scripter saves some state about the current
    session to a file, and quitting without using this menu item
    prevents this from happening.</p>
    
    <p>
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
	  <td width="100%"><nobr> <b>
		<font face="arial,helvetica">A First Program: CntToLeds</font>
	      </b></td> </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>Select the <code>Timer0</code> handler in the left panel. Then
    type this program into the program text area:
    
      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>

private counter;
counter = counter + 1;
call led(counter & 7);

	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>

      This is CntToLeds in TinyScript; it keeps a private variable
      <code>counter</code>, which it increments each time it
      executes. It then calls <code>led()</code> with the low three
      bits, to display them. Press <b>Inject</b>.</p>

    <p>In the shell you started Scripter from, you should see output
    similar to this:
    
      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>

Generating assembly.
Assembling to instruction set.

Garbage collecting variables

	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>

      This says that it was able to correctly compile the program to
      assembly code, translate that assembly to the VM opcodes, then
      send it. Scripter breaks larger programs up into "chunks," which
      is sends one by one. In this case, the program is nine bytes
      long and the chunk size is 28 bytes, so it sent a single
      chunk. Once the program has been sent, the Scripter checks what
      variables all of the handlers use to see if any shared variables
      (more on that later) can be reclaimed (garbage collected).</p>

    <p>When the Timer0 event fires, Mat&eacute; will run this
    code. However, Timer0 doesn't fire when the VM boots. We need to
    tell the VM to start firing Timer0. We'll do this with the Once
    handler. We'll need to use one of the Primitives,
    <code>settimer0</code>. Click on it in the right panel to read its
    description.</p>

    <p>Select the Once handler, and type this program:

            <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>
call settimer0(10);
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>

      This will start firing Timer0 at 1Hz, or once per second. Hit
      <b>Inject</b>. You should see the LEDs start ticking.</p>

    <p>
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
	  <td width="100%"><nobr> <b>
		<font face="arial,helvetica">TinyScript</font>
	      </b></td> </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>TinyScript programs have two sections. The first is the
    variable declaration region. In the Timer handler above, this was
    the <code>private counter;</code> statement. All variables must be
    declared before any statements. There are three kinds of
    variables: <code>private</code>, which only that handler can
    access, <code>shared</code>, which all handlers can access, and
    <code>buffer</code> variables, which are shared. For example, this
    program declares a shared variable, a private variable, a buffer,
    and turns on the red LED:
      

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>
shared data;
private value;
buffer cache;

call led(1); ! Turn on red led
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>

      Comments can be entered with <code>!</code>, which comments out
      everything until the end of line.</p>

    <p>Private and shared valuables can be either sensor readings,
    generated by primitives such as <code>temp</code> or
    <code>light</code>, or integers. Sensor readings are immutable;
    trying to modify them will result in a run-time error. You also
    cannot compare with with anything except sensor values of the same
    type (e.g., light with light). For example:

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>
private cond;
shared value;

cond = call rand() & 1;
if (cond) then
  value = call light();
else
  value = 20;
end if

value = value / 2;  ! This will fail if value is a light reading
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center> 

      If you need to modify sensor readings, say, for averaging, then
      you can cast them to integers with the <code>cast</code>
      primitive. This is a version of the above program that will execute
      without a run-time error:

            <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>
private cond;
shared value;

cond = call rand() & 1;
if (cond) then
  value = call cast(call light());
else
  value = 20;
end if

value = value / 2;  ! Now it works
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>
      </p>

    <p>Buffers are indexed with <code>[]</code>; by default, they have
    ten elements. An empty index implies the tail of the buffer;
    <code>call cast(buf[]);</code> will return an integer value of the
    end of the buffer, while <code>buf[] = 0;</code> will append to a
    buffer.</p>

    <p>Buffers are typed. An empty buffer has no type. The
    <code>bclear</code> primitive empties a buffer. A buffer takes the
    type of the first element put into it (integer, light reading,
    etc.), and a run-time error occurs if any other type is put into
    it. Here is a program that sends a light reading over a tree-based
    ad-hoc collection routing protocol:
            <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>
buffer buf;

call bclear(buf);
buf[] = call light();
call send(buf);
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>
      </p>
    
    <p>TinyScript supports basic arithmetic operations, such as
    addition (<code>+</code>), multiplication (<code>*</code>),
      division (<code>/</code>), modulus (<code>%</code>), as well as
      boolean operations such as and (<code>AND</code>) as well as or
      (<code>OR</code>), as well as their binary (logical) equivalents
    (<code>&</code>, <code>|</code>).</p>

    <p>Primitives are invoked with the <code>call</code> keyword
    (e.g., <code>call led(1);</code>). If the primitive has a return
    value (check its documentation), it must be stored. For example,
    <code>rand()</code> returns a random value. <code>call
    random();</code> will cause a compile error, while <code>rval =
    call random();</code> will not.</p>

    <p>Control structures include <code>if ... then</code> as shown
    above, as well as loops. For example, to put ten successive light
    values into a buffer:

            <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">
	      <code>
		<pre>
buffer buf;
private i;

call bclear(buf);

for i=0 to 9 
  buf[] = call light();
next i

call send(buf);
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>
    </p>

    <p>There are a limited number of buffers and variables. By
    default, there are 16 shared variables, eight private variables
    (per handler), and eight buffers.</p>
    
    <p>A full <A HREF="../mate-manual.pdf">reference</A> for
    TinyScript can be found in the standard documentation
    directory. This tutorial only covers a few major points.</p>

        <p>
      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>

	  face="arial,helvetica">Errors</font> </b></td> </tr> </table></p>
    

    
      <p>When Mat&eacute; encounters an error in a program
      (e.g. trying to add a light and temperture value), it enters an
      error state. In this error state, it stops running
      capsules. Instead, it periodically toggles all of the LEDs (all
      of them blinking on and off is an indication something has gone
      wrong) and sends a packet over the UART. The packet is a
      Mat&eacute;ErrorMsg and contains information on the cause of the
      error.</p>



        <p>

    <p>Here is a simple program, where each mote will periodically
    (one every ten seconds) sample its temperature and light sensors,
    but those values into a buffer, and route those to a base
    station. Note that, for this to work, there must be a routing base
    station (a node with ID 0).</p>

    <p>If Timer0 is running from the earlier part of the tutorial,
    stop it with the Once handler by <code>call
    settimer0(0);</code>. Then, install this as Timer0:

      <center>
	<table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	  <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	    <td width="100%">

if (counter >= 10) then
  call bclear(buf);
  buf[] = call cast(call light());
  buf[] = call cast(call temp());
  counter = 0;
  call send(buf);
end if
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>

    followed by this as Once:

      <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="80%" cellpadding=3>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	  <td width="100%">
	    <code>

call settimer0(10);
	      </pre>
	      </code>
	    </td></tr>
	</table>
      </center>

    Alternatively, instead of maintaining the counter value, you could
    <code>call settimer0(100);</code>.</p>
    
    <table border=0 hspace=4 cellspacing=2 width="100%" cellpadding=3>
      <tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">

    <p>By default, multiple Mat&eacute; handlers can run concurrently;
    the VM interleaves their execution at instruction-level
    granularity. When there are shared variables (and buffers), this
    can lead to possible race conditions. Using installation-time
    program analysis, Mat&eacute; ensures race-free, deadlock-free
    execution of handlers. If two handlers can safely run concurrently
    (they share no variables), then the scheduler lets them do so.</p>
    
    <p>This can fail due to handler installation. Notably, as
      handlers are installed immediately upon reception, a context
      can be in the midst of a computation when it is halted due to
      new code being installed.</p>
    
    <p>This means that to ensure perfect data consistency, the
      values of shared variables cannot be transferred from one
      version of a handler to the next. For example, before
      installing a new version of the clock handler, one could
      install a clock handler that clears out the shared variables,
      restoring them to a consistent state.</p>
    
    <p>We are currently working on a handler installation
      mechanism that will preserve execution atomicity; this
      understandably becomes difficult in the presence of buggy
      handlers that do not halt.</p>

    <p>This document just touches on Mat&eacute; and some simple
    programs that you can write with the example Bombilla
    VM. Mat&eacute; allows you to build customized VMs, with
    user-specified event handlers and primitives. For example, you can
    build a scripting environment that receives and sends packets,
    reacts to target detection, or acts as a data aggregation engine.
    For more information, please refer to the <A
    HREF="../mate-manual.pdf">Mat&eacute; manual</A></p>

    <p>Mat&eacute; is in active development. If you find bugs, please
    enter them in the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=28656&atid=393934">TinyOS bug tracker</A> on
    Sourceforge. Feature requests and questions should be sent to the
    standard TinyOS users list,
    <code>tinyos-users@millennium.berkeley.edu</code>. You can sign up
