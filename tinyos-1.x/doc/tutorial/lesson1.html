</p>
<p>The TinyOS system, libraries, and applications are written in nesC,
a new language for programming structured component-based applications.
The nesC language is primarily intended for embedded systems such as
sensor networks. nesC has a C-like syntax, but supports the TinyOS
concurrency model, as well as mechanisms for structuring, naming, and
linking together software components into robust network embedded
systems. The principal goal is to allow application designers to build
components that can be easily composed into complete, concurrent
systems, and yet perform extensive checking at compile time. </p>
<p>TinyOS defines a number of important concepts that are expressed in
nesC. First, nesC applications are built out of <b>components</b> with
well-defined, bidirectional <b>interfaces</b>. Second, nesC defines a
concurrency model, based on <b>tasks</b> and <b>hardware event handlers</b>,
and detects <b>data races</b> at compile time. </p>
<p><b>Components</b> <br>
<i>Specification</i> <br>
A nesC application consists of one or more&nbsp; <i>components </i>linked
together to form an executable. A component <b>provides</b> and <b>uses</b> <i>interfaces</i>.
These interfaces are the only point of access to the component and are
bi-directional.&nbsp; An interface declares a set of functions called <b>commands</b>
that the interface provider must implement and another set of functions
called <b>events</b> that the interface user must implement. For a
component to call the commands in an interface, it must implement the
events of that interface. A single component may use or provide
multiple interfaces and multiple instances of the same interface. </p>
<p><i>Implementation</i> <br>
There are two types of components in nesC: <b>modules</b> and <b>configurations</b>.
Modules provide application code, implementing one or more interface.
Configurations are used to assemble other components together,
connecting interfaces used by components to interfaces provided by
others. This is called <b>wiring</b>. Every nesC application is
described by a <b>top-level configuration</b> that <i>wires</i>
together the components inside. </p>
<p>nesC uses the filename extension "<tt>.nc</tt>" for all source files
-- interfaces, modules, and configurations. Please see <a
 href="naming.html">TinyOS Coding and Naming Conventions</a> for more
information on naming conventions. </p>
<p><b>Concurrency Model</b> <br>
TinyOS executes only one program consisting of selected system
components and custom components needed for a single application. There
are two threads of execution: <i>tasks</i> and <i>hardware event
handlers</i>. Tasks are functions whose execution is deferred.&nbsp;
Once scheduled, they run to completion and do not preempt one another.
Hardware event handlers are executed in response to a hardware
interrupt and also runs to completion, but may preempt the execution of
a task or other hardware event handler. Commands and events that are
executed as part of a hardware event handler must be declared with the <b>async</b>
keyword. </p>
<p>Because tasks and hardware event handlers may be preempted by other
asynchronous code, nesC programs are susceptible to certain race
conditions. Races are avoided either by accessing shared data
exclusively  within tasks, or by having all accesses within <b>atomic</b>
statements. The nesC compiler reports potential <i>data races</i> to the
programmer at compile-time. It is possible the compiler may report a
false positive. In this case a variable can be declared with the <b>norace</b>
keyword. The norace keyword should be used with extreme caution. </p>
<p>Please see the <a href="../../doc/nesc/ref.pdf">nesC Language
Reference Manual</a> for more information on programming in nesC. <br>

</p>
<p>So far this is all fairly abstract - let's look at a concrete
example: the simple test program "Blink" found in <tt><a
 href="../../apps/Blink">apps/Blink</a></tt> in the TinyOS tree. This
application simply causes the red LED on the mote to turn on and off at
1Hz. </p>
<p>Blink application is composed of two <b>components</b>: a <b>module</b>,
called "<tt>BlinkM.nc</tt>", and a <b>configuration</b>, called "<tt>Blink.nc</tt>".
Remember that all applications require a top-level configuration file,
which is typically named after the application itself. In this case <tt>Blink.nc</tt>
is the configuration for the Blink application and the source file that
the nesC compiler uses to generate an executable file. <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt>,
on the other hand, actually provides the <i>implementation</i> of the
Blink application. As you might guess, <tt>Blink.nc</tt> is used to
wire the <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt> module to other components that the Blink
application requires. </p>
<p>The reason for the distinction between modules and configurations is
to allow a system designer to quickly "snap together" applications. For
example, a designer could provide a configuration that simply wires
together one or more modules, none of which she actually designed.
Likewise, another developer can provide a new set of "library" modules
that can be used in a range of applications. </p>
<p>Sometimes (as is the case with <tt>Blink</tt> and <tt>BlinkM</tt>)
you will have a configuration and a module that go together. When this
is the case, the convention used in the TinyOS source tree is that <tt>Foo.nc</tt>
represents a configuration and <tt>FooM.nc</tt> represents the
corresponding module. While you could name an application's
implementation module and associated top-level configuration anything,
to keep things simple we suggest that you adopt this convention in your
own code. There are several other naming conventions used in TinyOS
code; a <a href="naming.html">summary</a> is provided

</p>
<p>The nesC compiler, <a href="../nesc/ncc.html">ncc</a>, compiles a
nesC application when given the file containing the top-level
configuration. Typical TinyOS applications come with a standard Makefile
that allows platform selection and invokes ncc with appropriate options
on the application's top-level configuration. </p>
<p>Let's look at <tt>Blink.nc</tt>, the configuration for this
application first: </p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="80%" hspace="4">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
      <td width="100%"><b>Blink.nc</b>
      <pre>configuration Blink {<br>}<br>implementation {<br>&nbsp; components Main, BlinkM, SingleTimer, LedsC;<br><br>&nbsp; Main.StdControl -&gt; BlinkM.StdControl;<br>&nbsp; Main.StdControl -&gt; SingleTimer.StdControl;<br>&nbsp; BlinkM.Timer -&gt; SingleTimer.Timer;<br>&nbsp; BlinkM.Leds -&gt; LedsC;<br>}</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>
<p>The first thing to notice is the key word <tt>configuration</tt>,
which indicates that this is a configuration file. The first two lines, </p>
<pre>&nbsp; configuration Blink {<br>&nbsp; }</pre>
simply state that this is a configuration called <tt>Blink</tt>.
Within the empty braces here it is possible to specify <tt>uses</tt>
and <tt>provides</tt> clauses, as with a module. This is important to
keep in mind: a configuration can use and provide interfaces!
<p>The actual configuration is implemented within the pair of curly
bracket following key word <tt>implementation </tt>. The <tt>components</tt>line
specifies the set of components that this configuration references, in
this case <tt>Main</tt>, <tt>BlinkM</tt>, <tt>SingleTimer</tt>, and <tt>LedsC</tt>.
The remainder of the implementation consists of connecting interfaces
used by components to interfaces provided by others. </p>
<p><tt>Main</tt> is a component that is executed first in a TinyOS
application. To be precise, the <tt>Main.StdControl.init()</tt> command
is the first command executed in TinyOS followed by
Main.StdControl.start(). Therefore, a TinyOS application must have Main
component in its configuration. <tt>StdControl</tt> is a common
interface used to initialize and start TinyOS components. Let us have a
look at <tt>tos/interfaces/StdControl.nc</tt>: </p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="80%" hspace="4">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
      <td width="100%"><b>StdControl.nc</b>
      <pre>interface StdControl {<br>&nbsp; command result_t init();<br>&nbsp; command result_t start();<br>&nbsp; command result_t stop();<br>}</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>
<p>We see that <tt>StdControl</tt> defines three <b>commands</b>, <tt>init()</tt>,<tt>start()</tt>,
and <tt>stop()</tt>. <tt>init()</tt> is called when a component is
first initialized, and <tt>start()</tt> when it is started, that is,
actually executed for the first time. <tt>stop()</tt> is called when
the component is stopped, for example, in order to power off the device
that it is controlling. <tt>init()</tt> can be called multiple times,
but will never be called after either <tt>start()</tt> or <tt>stop</tt>
are called. Specifically, the valid call patterns of StdControl are <tt>init*(start
| stop)* . </tt>All three of these commands have "deep" semantics;
calling <tt>init()</tt> on a component must make it call <tt>init()</tt>
on all of its subcomponents. The following 2 lines in Blink
configuration </p>
<pre>&nbsp; Main.StdControl -&gt; SingleTimer.StdControl;<br>&nbsp; Main.StdControl -&gt; BlinkM.StdControl;</pre>
wire the <tt>StdControl</tt> interface in <tt>Main</tt> to the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface in both <tt>BlinkM</tt> and <tt>SingleTimer</tt>. <tt>SingleTimer.StdControl.init()</tt>and<tt>BlinkM.StdControl.init()</tt>
will be called by <tt>Main.StdControl.init()</tt>. The same rule
applies to the <tt>start() and <font color="#000000">stop() </font></tt>commands.
<p>Concerning <i>used</i> interfaces, it is important to note that
subcomponent initialization functions must be explicitly called by the
using component. For example, the BlinkM module uses the interface
Leds, so Leds.init() is called explicitly in BlinkM.init(). </p>
<p>nesC uses arrows to determine relationships between interfaces.
Think of the right arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>) as "binds to". The left side
of the arrow binds an interface to an implementation on the right side.
In other words, the component that <b>uses</b> an interface is on the
left, and the component <b>provides </b>the interface is on the right. </p>
<p>The line </p>
<pre>&nbsp; BlinkM.Timer -&gt; SingleTimer.Timer;</pre>
is used to wire the <tt>Timer</tt> interface used by BlinkM to the
Timer interface provided by SingleTimer. <tt>BlinkM.Timer</tt> on the
left side of the arrow is referring to the <i>interface</i> called
Timer (<tt>tos/interfaces/Timer.nc</tt>), while SingleTimer.Timer on
the right side of the arrow is referring to the <i>implementation </i>of
Timer (<tt>tos/lib/SingleTimer.nc)</tt>. Remember that the arrow always
binds interfaces (on the left) to implementations (on the right).
<p>nesC supports multiple implementations of the same interface. The <tt>Timer</tt>interface
is such a example. The <tt>SingleTimer </tt>component implements a
single <tt>Timer</tt> interface while another component, <tt>TimerC, </tt>implements
multiple timers using timer id as a parameter. Further discussions on
timers can be found in Lesson 2. </p>
<p>Wirings can also be implicit. For example, </p>
<pre>&nbsp; BlinkM.Leds -&gt; LedsC;</pre>
is really shorthand for
<pre>&nbsp; BlinkM.Leds -&gt; LedsC.Leds;</pre>
If no interface name is given on the right side of the arrow, the nesC
compiler by default tries to bind to the same interface as on the left
side of the arrow. <br>

</center>
<p>The first part of the code states that this is a module called <tt>BlinkM</tt>and
declares the interfaces it provides and uses.&nbsp; The <tt>BlinkM</tt>&nbsp;
module <b>provides</b> the<b> </b>interface <tt>StdControl</tt>.&nbsp;
This means that <tt>BlinkM</tt> implements the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface.&nbsp; As explained above, this is necessary to get the Blink
component initialized and started.&nbsp; The BlinkM module also <b>uses</b>
two interfaces: <tt>Leds</tt> and <tt>Timer. </tt>This means that
BlinkM may call any command declared in the interfaces it uses and must
also implement any events declared in those interfaces. </p>
<p><tt>The Leds </tt>interface defines several commands like <tt>redOn()</tt>,<tt>redOff()</tt>,
and so forth, which turn the different LEDs (red, green, or yellow) on
the mote on and off. Because <tt>BlinkM</tt> uses the <tt>Leds</tt>
interface, it can invoke any of these commands. Keep in mind, however,
that <tt>Leds</tt> is just an interface: the implementation is
specified in the Blink.nc configuration file. </p>
<p><tt>Timer.nc</tt> is a little more interesting: </p>
<center>

    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
      <td width="100%"><b>Timer.nc</b>
      <pre>interface Timer {<br>&nbsp; command result_t start(char type, uint32_t interval);<br>&nbsp; command result_t stop();<br>&nbsp; event result_t fired();<br>}</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>
<p>Here we see that <tt>Timer</tt> interface defines the <tt>start()</tt>
and <tt>stop()</tt> commands, and the <tt>fired() </tt>event. </p>
<p>The <tt>start()</tt> command is used to specify the type of the
timer and the interval at which the timer will expire. The unit of the
interval argument is millisecond. The valid types are <tt>TIMER_REPEAT</tt>
and <tt>TIMER_ONE_SHOT</tt>. A one-shot timer ends after the specified
interval, while a repeat timer goes on and on until it is stopped by
the <tt>stop() </tt>command. </p>
<p>How does an application know that its timer has expired? The answer
is when it receives an event. The <tt>Timer</tt> interface provides an
event: </p>
<pre>&nbsp; event result_t fired();</pre>
An <b>event</b> is a function that the implementation of an interface
will signal when a certain event takes place. In this case, the <tt>fired()</tt>
event is signaled when the specified interval has passed. This is an
example of a <b>bi-directional interface</b>: an interface not only
provides <b>commands</b> that can be called <i>by users</i> of the
interface, but also signals <b>events</b> that call handlers <i>in the
user</i>. Think of an event as a callback function that the
implementation of an interface will invoke. A module that <b>uses</b>
an interface <i>must implement the events</i> that this interface uses.
<p>Let's look at the rest of <tt>BlinkM.nc</tt> to see how this all
fits together: </p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="80%" hspace="4">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
      <td width="100%"><b>BlinkM.nc, continued</b>
      <pre>implementation {<br><br>&nbsp; command result_t StdControl.init() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call Leds.init();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return SUCCESS;<br>&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp; command result_t StdControl.start() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return call Timer.start(TIMER_REPEAT, 1000) ;<br>&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp; command result_t StdControl.stop() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return call Timer.stop();<br>&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp; event result_t Timer.fired()<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call Leds.redToggle();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return SUCCESS;<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>
<p>This is simple enough. As we see the <tt>BlinkM</tt> module
implements the <tt>StdControl.init()</tt>, <tt>StdControl.start()</tt>,
and <tt>StdControl.stop()</tt> commands, since it provides the <tt>StdControl</tt>
interface. It also implements the <tt>Timer.fired()</tt> event, which is
necessary since <tt>BlinkM</tt> must implement any event from an
interface it uses. </p>
<p>The <tt>init()</tt> command in the implemented <tt>StdControl </tt>interface
simply initializes the Leds subcomponent with the call to <tt>Leds.init()</tt>.
The <tt>start()</tt> command invokes <tt>Timer.start()</tt> to create a
repeat timer that expires every 1000 ms. <tt>stop()</tt> terminates the
timer. Each time <tt>Timer.fired()</tt> event is triggered, the <tt>Leds.redToggle()</tt>
toggles the red LED. </p>
<p>You can view a graphical representation of the component
relationships within an application. TinyOS source files include
metadata within comment blocks that ncc, the nesC compiler, uses to
automatically generate html-formatted documentation. To generate the
documentation, type <tt>make &lt;platform&gt; docs</tt> from the
application directory. The resulting documentation is located in <tt>docs/nesdoc/&lt;platform&gt;</tt>.<tt>docs/nesdoc/&lt;platform&gt;/index.html</tt>

<p>TinyOS supports multiple platforms. Each platform has its own
directory in the <a href="../../tos/platform">tos/platform</a>
directory. In this tutorial, we will use the mica platform as an
example. If you are in the TinyOS source tree, compiling the <tt>Blink</tt>
application for the Mica mote is as simple as typing </p>
<pre>&nbsp; make mica</pre>
in the <tt><a href="../../apps/Blink">apps/Blink</a></tt> directory. Of
course this doesn't tell you anything about how the nesC compiler is
invoked.
<p>nesC itself is invoked using the <a href="../nesc/ncc.html"><tt>ncc</tt></a>
command which is based on <tt>gcc</tt>. For example, you can type </p>
<pre>&nbsp; ncc -o main.exe -target=mica Blink.nc</pre>
to compile the <tt>Blink</tt> application (from the <tt>Blink.nc</tt>
top-level configuration) to <tt>main.exe</tt>, an executable file for
the Mica mote. Before you can upload the code to the mote, you use
<pre>&nbsp; avr-objcopy --output-target=srec main.exe main.srec</pre>
to produce <tt>main.srec</tt>, which essentially represents the binary <tt>main.exe</tt>
file in a text format that can be used for programming the mote. You
then use another tool (such as <tt>uisp</tt>) to actually upload the
code to the mote, depending on your environment. In general you will
never need to invoke <tt>ncc</tt> or <tt>avr-objcopy</tt> by hand, the
Makefile does all this for you, but it's nice to see that all you need
to compile a nesC application is to run <tt>ncc</tt> on the top-level
configuration file for your application. <tt>ncc</tt> takes care of
locating and compiling all of the different components required by your
application, linking them together, and ensuring that all of the
component wiring matches up. <br>

<p>Now that we've compiled the application it's time to program the
mote and run it. This example will use the Mica mote and the
parallel-port-based programming board (<span

use the other programming boards are <a href="programmers.html">here</a>.
To download your program onto the mote, place the mote board (or mote
and sensor stack) into the bay on the programming board, as shown
below. You can either supply a 3 volt supply to the connector on the
programming board or power the node directly. The red LED (labeled D2)
on the programming board will be on when power is supplied. If you are
using batteries to power the mote, be sure the mote is switched on (the
power switch should be towards the connector). </p>
<p>Plug the 32-pin connector into the parallel port of a computer
configured with the TinyOS tools, using a standard DB32 parallel port
cable. </p>

<p>If you are using an IBM ThinkPad, it may be necessary to tell the

line </p>
<pre>&nbsp; PROGRAMMER_EXTRA_FLAGS = -dlpt=3</pre>
to the <tt>apps/Makelocal</tt> file (create it if it doesn't exist).

You can now test the program by unplugging the mote from the
programming board and turning on the power switch (if it's not already
on). With any luck the red LED should light up every second -
congratulations!
<p>Typing <tt>make clean</tt> in the <tt>Blink</tt> directory will
clean up the compiled binary files. </p>
<p>If you are still having errors, then you need to check your TinyOS
installation and check the Mica hardware. See <a href="verifyhw.html">System
and Hardware Verification</a> for details. <br>

<p>To test your new-found TinyOS programming skills, try out the
following: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Modify <tt>Blink</tt> to display the lower three bits of a
counter in the LEDs.</li>
</ul>
<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%"
 hspace="4">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">
      <td width="100%"><b><nobr><font face="arial,helvetica">Conclusion</font></nobr></b></td>

<p>This tutorial has just scratched the surface of nesC's syntax and
features. Rather than document everything extensively, we refer the
reader to the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/nescc/">nesC
Project Pages</a> as well as the documentation included with the nesC
distribution in <tt>nesc/doc</tt>. These sources contain more complete
documentation on the language. </p>
<p>Hopefully this should be enough of a start to get you going on
programming in this fun new language. </p>
