<p>TOSSIM, the TinyOS simulator, compiles directly from TinyOS code. Built
with <tt>make pc</tt>, the simulation runs natively on a desktop or laptop.
TOSSIM can simulate thousands of nodes simultaneously. Every mote in a
simulation runs the same TinyOS program.
<p>TOSSIM provides run-time configurable debugging output, allowing a user
to examine the execution of an application from different perspectives
without needing to recompile. TinyViz is a Java-based GUI that allows you
to visualize and control the simulation as it runs, inspecting debug messages,
radio and UART packets, and so forth. The simulation provides several mechanisms
for interacting with the network; packet traffic can be monitored, packets
can be statically or dynamically injected into the network. In this lesson,
we won't be dealing with packet injection, which is discussed in <a href="lesson7.html">Lesson
7</a> .

an Application</font></nobr></b></td>

</table>

<p>TOSSIM is compiled by typing <tt>make pc</tt> in an application directory.
In addition to the expected TinyOS components, a few simulator-specific
files are compiled; these files provide functionality such as support for
network monitoring over TCP sockets.
<p>Enter the <tt><a href="../../apps/CntToLedsAndRfm">apps/CntToLedsAndRfm</a></tt>
directory. This application runs a 4Hz counter. It assumes a Mica mote
which has 3 LEDs. On each counter tick, the application displays the least
significant three bits of the counter on the three mote LEDs and sends
the entire 16-bit value in a packet. Build and install the application
on a Mica mote as in Lesson 4. You should see the LEDs blink.
<p>Build a TOSSIM version of the application with <tt>make pc</tt>. The
TOSSIM executable is <tt>build/pc/main.exe</tt>. Type <tt>build/pc/main.exe
--help</tt> to see a brief summary of its command-line usage. TOSSIM has
a single required parameter, the number of nodes to simulate. Type <tt>build/pc/main.exe
1</tt> to run a simulation of a single node. You should see a long stream
of output fly by, most of which refer to radio bit events. Hit control-C
to stop the simulation.
<p>By default, TOSSIM prints out all debugging information. As radio bit
events are fired at 20 or 40 KHz, these are the most frequent events in
the simulator, they comprise most of the output in CntToLedsAndRfm. Given
the application, we're more concerned with the packet output and mote LEDs
than individual radio bits. TOSSIM output can be configured by setting
the <tt>DBG</tt> environment variable in a shell. Type <tt>export DBG=am,led</tt>
in your shell; this makes only LED and AM (active messages) packet output
enabled. Run the one-mote simulation again. You should see output similar
to this:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >

</table></center>

<p>The sixth byte of the packet contains the least significant byte of
the two byte counter; in this example the first packet is hex 0x20 (32),
in the second, it's hex 0x21 (33). As the LEDs show the bottom three bits
of the counter, they are all off for the first packet and bit one is on
for the second.
<p>Almost every message is preceded by a <tt>0:</tt>; this means that the
message pertains to the execution of mote 0. Run a simulation of two motes
(<tt>build/pc/main.exe 2</tt>); after it runs for a few seconds, stop the
simulation with control-C. You should see messages for both mote 0 and
mote 1.
<p>Set <tt>DBG</tt> to <tt>crc</tt>. Run two mote simulation of <tt>CntToLedsAndRfm</tt>.
You should see output indicating that both nodes are successfully receiving
packets from each-other.
<p>The full set of DBG modes can be seen by typing <tt>build/pc/main.exe
--help</tt>; they are listed at the bottom of the output.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0FF">
<td WIDTH="100%"><b><nobr><font face="arial,helvetica">Adding Debugging
Statements</font></nobr></b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Four DBG modes are reserved for application components and debugging
use: <tt>usr1</tt>, <tt>usr2</tt>, <tt>usr3</tt>, and <tt>temp</tt>. In
TinyOS code, debug message commands have this syntax:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre>dbg(&lt;mode>, const char* format, ...);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>The mode parameter specifies which under which DBG modes this message
will be printed. The full set of modes can be found in <tt><a href="../../tos/types/dbg_modes.h">tos/types/dbg_modes.h</a></tt>.
The format and following parameters specify the string to output and have
<tt>printf()</tt>
semantics. For example, open <tt><a href="../../tos/lib/Counters/Counter.nc">tos/lib/Counters/Counter.nc</a></tt>in
your editor. In <tt>Timer.fired()</tt>, add this line just before the return
statement:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre>dbg(DBG_TEMP, "Counter: Value is %i\n", (int)state);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Set <tt>DBG</tt> to be <tt>temp</tt> and run a single mote simulation.
You'll see the counter increment. In general, the DBG mode name in TinyOS
code is the name used when you run the simulator, with <tt>DBG_</tt>prepended.
For example, <tt>am</tt> is <tt>DBG_AM</tt>, <tt>packet</tt> is <tt>DBG_PACKET</tt>
and <tt>boot</tt> is <tt>DBG_BOOT</tt>.
<p>Just as you can enable multiple modes when running the simulator, a
single debug message can be activated on multiple modes. Each mode is a
bit in a large bitmask; one can use all of the standard logical operators
(e.g. <tt>|</tt>, <tt>~</tt>) . For example, change the debug message you
just added to:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre>dbg(DBG_TEMP|DBG_USR1, "Counter: Value is %i\n", (int)state);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>It will now be printed if either <tt>temp</tt> or <tt>usr1</tt> is enabled.
Run the application to see this is the case.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0FF">
<td WIDTH="100%"><b><nobr><font face="arial,helvetica">Using gdb with TOSSIM</font></nobr></b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>One significant advantage of TOSSIM is that, because it runs natively
on a PC, you can use traditional debugging tools such as <tt>gdb</tt>.
However, because TOSSIM is a discrete event simulation for large numbers
of motes, traditional step-through debugging techniques only work on an
event basis, and not cross-events.
<p>Unfortunately, <tt>gdb</tt> is generally designed for C and not nesC;
the component model of nesC means that a single command can have multiple
providers; referring to a specific command requires specifying the component,
interface, and command. For example, to break on entry to the <tt>redOff</tt>
command of the <tt>Leds</tt> interface of <tt>LedsC</tt>, one must type:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre>&nbsp;gdb build/pc/main.exe&nbsp; // start gdb

(gdb) break *LedsC$Leds$redOff
Breakpoint 1 at 0x804c644: file tos/system/LedsC.td, line 97.

run 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // run CntToLedsAndRfm with one mote</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>The leading * is necessary so <tt>gdb</tt> can parse the function name
correctly; otherwise, it looks for the function <tt>LedsC</tt>.
<p>Variables are similarly named. For example, to print the <tt>ledsOn</tt>
variable of <tt>LedsC</tt> (which keeps track of on/off for the toggle
commands), one types:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre>(gdb) print LedsC$ledsOn
$3 = '\0' &lt;repeats 999 times></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Actually, this isn't quite correct, as the output above shows; in TOSSIM,
<tt>ledsOn</tt>
isn't a single <tt>uint8_t</tt>, but an array of 1000 of them. This is
how TOSSIM handles the state of many motes; it compiles fields to be arrays
of <i>n</i> elements, where <i>n</i> is the maximum simulation size. Whenever
a mote accesses a component's state, it indexes into the array based on
its node ID. Therefore, to refer to a specific mote's state, one needs
to index into the array properly:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre>(gdb) print LedsC$ledsOn[tos_state.current_node]
$2 = 0 '\0'</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>We've supplied a simple <tt>gdb</tt> macro named <tt>VAR</tt> that handles
this for you. Copy <tt><a href="../../tos/platform/pc/.gdbinit">tos/platform/pc/.gdbinit</a></tt>
to your home directory (if there's already a <tt>.gdbinit</tt> there, just
append this file).&nbsp; Type <tt>quit</tt> and start <tt>gdb</tt> it again.
Break in <tt>LedsC$Leds$redOff</tt> as before. Now, instead of the above
command line, you can type:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">

<p>TinyViz provides an extensible graphical user interface for debugging,
visualizing, and interacting with TOSSIM simulations of TinyOS applications.
Using TinyViz, you can easily trace the execution of TinyOS apps, set breakpoints
when interesting events occur, visualize radio messages, and manipulate
the virtual position and radio connectivity of motes. In addition, TinyViz
supports a simple "plugin" API that allows you to write your own TinyViz
modules to visualize data in an application-specific way, or interact with
the running simulation.

</table>

<p>To get started, look at the <tt><a href="../../apps/TestTinyViz/TestTinyVizM.nc">apps/TestTinyViz</a></tt>
application, which causes motes to periodically send a message to a random
neighbor. There isn't anything interesting about the application itself,
but it will allow us to demonstrate the basic features of TinyViz. Go ahead
and build the app with <tt>make pc</tt>.
<p>To compile TinyViz, <tt>cd</tt> to the <tt>tools/java/net/tinyos/sim</tt>
directory and type <tt>make</tt>. This will build the TinyOS program as
<tt>tinyviz.jar</tt>,
a stand-alone Java JAR file that you can run with the <tt>tinyviz</tt>
script, found in this directory. Place this script on your PATH and you
will be able to run <tt>tinyviz</tt> directly from the command line.
<p>Start up TinyViz, running the <tt>TestTinyViz</tt> app, as follows:
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre><tt>export DBG=usr1
tinyviz -run build/pc/main.exe 30</tt></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>You will see a window looking something like the following:
<center><a href="imgs/tinyviz-screenshot1.gif"><img SRC="imgs/tinyviz-screenshot1-small.png" height=356 width=636></a></center>

<p>On the left is the graphical display of the sensor network. On the right
is the control panel where you can interact with a series of
<b>plugins</b>
that control how TinyViz works.
<p>In the mote window, you can select motes by clicking on them, or select
a group of motes by dragging a rectangle around the group. You can move
motes around by dragging them around. Selecting motes is meaningful for
certain plugins, and other operations, such as toggling the power state
of the motes.
<p>The "pause/play" button pauses or resumes the simulation. The "grid
button" toggles grid-lines on the display. The "clear" button clears out
the display state. The "stop" button kills the simulation. The "delay"
slider introduces a delay between the handling of each TOSSIM event, which
will slow down the display -- useful in cases where you have a small number
of motes and want to watch the simulation operating in "real time". The
"On/off" button toggles the power state of the selected motes.
<p><b>Plugins</b>
<p>A TinyViz <b>plugin</b> is a software module that watches for events
coming from the simulation -- such as debug messages, radio messages, and
so forth -- and reacts by drawing information on the display, setting simulation
parameters, or actuating the simulation itself, for example, by setting
the sensor values that simulated motes will read. TinyViz comes with a
suite of built-in plugins, in the
<tt><a href="../../tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/plugins">tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/plugins</a></tt>
directory, and you can write your own. Not all plugins are used for all
applications -- for example, the <tt>Calamari</tt> plugin is used mainly
for testing the Calamari localization service -- but many of them are generally
useful.
<p>Plugins can be selectively enabled or disabled, depending on what information
you are interested in seeing during the simulation. You select plugins
from the <tt>Plugins</tt> menu. When a plugin is enabled, its corresponding
tab in the right-hand control panel window is active, which may have additional
information and controls provided by that plugin. Plugins are designed
to be independent of each other so you can enable or disable any group
of plugins you like.
<p>The main plugins you are likely to use are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Debug messages:</b> Shows a window with all of the debug messages generated
by the simulation. You can select debug messages just from the selected
group of motes, and also highlight messages that match a certain pattern.
Note that the set of debug messages you see are controlled by the value
of the <tt>DBG</tt> environment variable, just as they are when running
TOSSIM in a stand-alone setting. So, if you only want to see debug messages
of type <tt>DBG_USR1</tt> and
<tt>DBG_AM</tt>, start up TinyViz with:</li>

<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre><tt>DBG=usr1,am tinyviz -run build/pc/main.exe 30</tt></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<li>
<b>Set breakpoint:</b> Allows you to set a breakpoint, which will pause
the simulation when some condition is met. Right now, the possible conditions
are (a) a substring match on a debug message, or (b) a match on the contents
of a sent radio message. Multiple breakpoints can be set and they can be
enabled or disabled by selecting them in the breakpoints list.</li>

<li>
<b>ADC readings:</b> Shows the most recent value of each ADC channel next
to each mote.</li>

<li>
<b>Sent radio packets:</b> Shows a window with all sent radio packets,
much like the <b>Debug messages</b> plugin. Note that the
<b>Debug messages</b>
plugin also shows this information.</li>

<li>
<b>Radio links:</b> Graphically displays radio message activity. When a
mote broadcasts a message, a blue circle will be drawn around it. When
a mote sends a message to another mote, a directed arrow will be drawn
between the two motes. Note that this shows all message transmissions,
regardless of whether they are successful; if a mote attempts to send a
message but it is corrupted or lost, the arrow will still be drawn.</li>

<li>
<b>Set location:</b> Makes the virtual location of each mote available
to that mote through the <tt>Location</tt> interface, found in
<tt><a href="../../apps/TestTinyViz/Location.nc">apps/TestTinyViz/Location.nc</a></tt>.
This is accomplished by setting the value of three "fake" ADC channels
(one each for X, Y, and Z coordinates) on each mote, which the <tt>FakeLocation</tt>
component reads to determine the mote's virtual location. This is meant
to act as a stand-in for a real localization service when simulating TinyOS
apps.</li>

<li>
<b>Radio model</b>: Sets the bit error rate between motes according to
their location and various models of radio connectivity. Enabling this
plugin allows you to use realistic connectivity models in your simulations.
There are two built-in models: "Empirical" (based on an outdoor trace of
packet connectivity with the RFM1000 radios) and "Fixed radius" (all motes
within a given fixed distance of each other have perfect connectivity,
and no connectivity to other motes). Setting the "scaling factor" in the
control panel simply scales the distance parameter of the model. <b>Increasing</b>
the scaling factor will <b>decrease</b> the connectivity range of the chosen
model. By selecting a mote in the display you can see its connectivity
to other motes -- the number shown next to each edge is the probability
of a packet getting through. Changing the scaling factor and clicking "update
model" will update the model parameters, as will moving motes around in
the display.</li>
</ul>
<b>Layout</b>
<p>Layout of the motes is controlled by the <tt>Layout</tt> menu, which
gives you several options including random, grid-based, or a "grid+random"
(grid-based but with a random perturbation) layout. You can also save and
load layouts from a file. The location of the motes on the display is used
in two ways. First, it is used to determine radio connectivity, when the
<tt>RadioModelPlugin</tt>
is enabled. Second, it is used to set the virtual location of the motes,
when using the <tt>LocationPlugin</tt>.
<p><b>Trying it out</b>
<p>OK, now we're ready to try out the various features.
<ol>
<li>
Startup TinyViz with <tt>DBG=usr1, tinyviz -run build/pc/main.exe 30</tt>
if it is not already running.</li>

<li>
Select the <b>Debug messages</b>, <b>Radio links</b>, and <b>Set breakpoint</b>
plugins from the Plugins menu, and resume the simulation by clicking the
pause/play button.</li>

<li>
Clicking on the <b>Debug messages</b> tab in the control panel will show
you all of the debug messages generated by the simulation. Click on a given
mote (say, mote 3) then click "Selected motes only" to restrict the display
to just that mote.</li>

<li>
Type a phrase (for example, "Received") in the box at the bottom of the
control panel, then click "Highlight". This will highlight all messages
matching the chosen string - very useful for visually scanning for "interesting"
messages.</li>

<li>
Pause the simulation, then click on the "Set breakpoint" tab. Pull down
the bar at the top of the control panel (which says "Current breakpoints")
and choose "Add debug message breakpoint". In the "Message contains" box,
type "Received message", then click "Enable breakpoint". This will add
a new breakpoint that pauses the simulation whenever a matching debug message
is printed. Click on the pause/play button to resume the simulation. Very
soon afterwards, the simulation will pause and the control panel at the
bottom of the screen will print something like</li>

<pre>Breakpoint 0 fired: Debug message: [24] DebugMsgEvent [24: TestTinyVizM: Received message from 13]</pre>
which simply means that this debug message triggered the breakpoint. Clicking
the play button again will resume the simulation, causing the breakpoint
to be hit again.
<li>
Select "Current breakpoints" from the bar at the top of the control panel.
Disable the breakpoint by clicking on it in the breakpoints list, then
click "Disable breakpoint".</li>

<li>
Select the <b>Radio model</b> plugin from the Plugins menu and click on
the "Radio model" tab in the control panel, then pick "Fixed radius (100.0)"
from the list of radio models. Drag the mouse across the mote display to
select all motes; you will see a very densely-connected mesh, indicating
that nearly every mote has connectivity with all others, due to the large
radius of the radio model. Type "4" in the "Distance scaling factor" box,
then click "Update model". The radio model will be updated -- which may
take some time -- and the resulting connectivity mesh will be much more
sparse.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Note that once you restart the simulation, nodes that can no longer
communicate (due to no connectivity) will still be sending messages to
each other; this is because the <tt>TestTinyViz</tt> application accumulates
a list of nodes to send messages to, but changing the underlying connectivity
model does not modify this list. <i>However,</i> if you watch the debug
messages from each node, you will notice that nodes are only <b>receiving</b>
messages from those nodes they are connected to, as you would expect.</ol>
<b>AutoRun - Scripting TOSSIM runs</b>
<p>The TinyViz <b>AutoRun</b> feature allows you to "script" the configuration
and execution of a TinyOS simulation, by setting parameters in a file that
controls TinyViz. This allows you to automatically enable plugins, set
breakpoints, run multiple simulations, log data to files, and execute commands
both before and after each simulation runs. This is useful when you are
using TinyViz as an analysis tool.
<p>Look at the file <tt><a href="../../apps/TestTinyViz/sample.autorun">apps/TestTinyViz/sample.autorun</a></tt>
in the <tt>TestTinyViz</tt> directory. The autorun file specifies one or
more simulations to run; a simulation stops either when a specified number
of simulated seconds have elapsed (the "<tt>numsec</tt>" option), when
a substring match on a debug message occurs (the "<tt>stopstring</tt>"
option), or when the simulation exits itself (e.g., a crash or deliberate
call to <tt>exit()</tt>). The parameters for each simulation are separated
by a blank line. When a parameter is set in the file for one simulation,
it will carry forward for subsequent simulations in the file, saving you
from having to re-specify parameters for each run.
<p>Here is the sample file:
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre><tt># This is a sample TinyViz autorun file. To use it, run
#&nbsp;&nbsp; tinyviz -autorun sample.autorun
# Set the layout

# Enable some plugins
plugin DebugMsgPlugin
plugin RadioLinkPlugin
plugin RadioModelPlugin
# Total number of simulated seconds to run

# Name of the executable file

# DBG messages to include

# The radio model and scaling factor to use

# Number of motes

# Command to run before starting
precmd echo "This is a command that will run before the simulation"
# File to log all DBG messages to

# The blank line above indicates that we are starting another simulation
# This time run with a different number of motes
nummotes 30
logfile logfile-30.txt</tt></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>The AutoRun file specifies two simulations, one with 20 motes and another
with 30. All debug messages are logged to two different logfiles. We enable
a few different plugins (specified by the Java class names as they are
found in <tt>tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/plugins</tt>.
<p>To run the simulations with this autorun file, just type:
<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" hspace="4" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0">
<td WIDTH="100%">
<pre><tt>tinyviz -autorun sample.autorun</tt></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>TinyViz starts up, enables and configures the appropriate plugins, and
automatically runs each simulation for 10 simulated seconds, then exits.
You can set up AutoRun to run a series of simulations and then go to lunch
-- the data will be waiting for you in your logfiles when you get back.
<p>AutoRun supports a number of features not shown here -- just look at
the <tt>arConfig</tt> class in the
<tt><a href="../../tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/AutoRun.java">tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/AutoRun.java</a></tt>source
file. Note that all options specified in the file that aren't used by AutoRun
itself, however they made available to plugins. So, for example, the <tt>radiomodel</tt>
option is interpreted by the
<tt>RadioModelPlugin</tt> to configure the
radio model. You can write your own plugins that are configured through
AutoRun in this way.
<p><b>Writing TinyViz plugins</b>
<p>By far the most useful feature of TinyViz is the ability to write your
own plugins to interact with the simulation. Writing plugins is beyond
the scope of this document, but we wanted to give you a couple of pointers
on where to start. Look at <tt><a href="../../tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/plugins/RadioLinkPlugin.java">tools/java/net/tinyos/sim/plugins/RadioLinkPlugin.java</a></tt>for
a simple, well-documented plugin implementation. Essentially, plugins must
provide a method that receives events from the TOSSIM simulation and the
TinyViz framework. Plugins react to events by changing internal state,
updating the display, or possibly sending commands back into the simulation.
TinyViz delivers events to plugins for initialization, debug messages,
radio messages, a change in the location of a mote (e.g., when the user
moves it), and when new motes join the simulation. Plugins provide additional
methods that are called when the plugin is enabled or disabled, as well
as when the mote window is redrawn.
<p>Using <tt>RadioLinkPlugin.java</tt> as an example, it is straightforward
to write your own plugins. Currently, all plugins must be located in the
<tt>plugins</tt>
subdirectory of the TinyViz directory. (In the future we will add support
for a "plugin path"). Note that when you modify a plugin you need to recompile
the <tt>tinyviz.jar</tt> file by typing
<tt>make </tt>in the main TinyViz
directory (tools/java/net/tinyos/sim); just typing <tt>make</tt> in the
plugins directory is not adequate.

<p>This tutorial only covers some of the functionality and usefulness of
TOSSIM; for example, as TOSSIM simulates the TinyOS networking stack at
bit granularity, radio models can simulate some of the difficult issues
that arise. Similarly, one can test and debug low-level protocols (such
as start symbol detection) in addition to application components and routing
protocols. The <a href="../nido.pdf">TOSSIM System Description</a> goes
into greater details on these capabilities and presents some information
on TOSSIM's implementation.
