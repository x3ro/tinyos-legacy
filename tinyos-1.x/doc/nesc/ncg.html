<h3>NAME</h3>

<blockquote>
ncg - extract constants from nesC files
</blockquote>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

<blockquote>
ncg [any ncc option] 
[<b>-o</b> <u>output-file</u>]
[<b>-java-classname=</b><u>full-class-name</u>]
[<b>-java-extends=</b><u>class-name</u>]
<u>tool</u> <u>nesC-file</u> <u>filenames-or-constant-names...</u>
</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<blockquote>

ncg is a tool to extract constants from nesC files for use with other
applications. It is typically used in conjunction with <a
href="mig.html">mig</a> (which generates code to process TinyOS messages)
to extract constants that are used in particular TinyOS messages (e.g.,
constants representing various commands).  

<p>The <u>tool</u> argument specifies what tool should be generated, the
<u>nesC-file</u> specifies your application's top-level nesC file.  If your
constants are all in a single .h file that does not depend on any other
files, then you can specify the .h file directly as the
<u>msg-format-file</u>.

Each <u>filenames-or-constant-names</u> is either a constant name (if it
consists only of letters, numbers and _) or a filename. In the former case,
the specified constant will be extracted, in the latter case all constants
from the specified C file will be extracted. Only constants declared in C
files will be found by ncg.

<p>
Currently there is only one tool, <b>java</b>, which generates a java class
that contains the values of the requested constants. The <b>-java-*</b>
options are specific to this tool. It is described below.

<p>
<b>-o</b> <u>output-file</u> <blockquote> specify the file in which to
output the generated code.</blockquote>

ncg works by invoking ncc. It will generally be necessary to pass some options
through to ncc so that your file can be compiled. Some commonly necessary
options are:
<p>
<b>-target=<u>known-tinyos-platform</u></b> <blockquote> specify the target
architecture of your TinyOS application which is generating or receiving
messages. So, e.g., if compiling your application for tossim specify
-target=pc. The default target is ncc's default target.</blockquote>


<b>-I</b> <u>dir</u> <blockquote> specify an additional search directory
for nesC components.</blockquote>


<b>-board=<u>known-tinyos-sensorboard</u></b><blockquote> specify one (or
more) sensor boards. This effects the search path and preprocessor symbols
(and may therefore be necessary when feeding a file to ncg).</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<h3>JAVA TOOL</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This tool generates a java class with the values of the requested constants.
These constant will be <code>public final static</code> and have a type chosen
from <code>byte, short, char, int, long</code> (the chosen type will be the 
first one in this list that can hold the constants value - this reduces
the need for casts).

<p>
The java tool accepts the following options:

<p>
<b>-java-classname=</b><u>full-class-name</u> <blockquote> this option is
 required and specifies the package and name of the generated class. If the
 full-class-name has no '.', then no package directive is included in the
 output.</blockquote>

<b>-java-extends=</b><u>class-name</u>: <blockquote> specify the class the
generated class will extend.  The default is
net.tinyos.message.Message.</blockquote>

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

<blockquote>
        APPDIR=`ncc -print-tosdir`/lib/FS<br>
	ncg -I%T/lib/FS -java-classname=net.tinyos.matchbox.FS java
$APPDIR/Remote.nc Matchbox.h Remote.h -oFS.java
</blockquote>

<h3>ERRORS</h3>

<blockquote>
ncg reports an error if ncc cannot compile <u>nesC-file</u>.
