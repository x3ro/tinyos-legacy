</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<blockquote>
ncc is an extension to gcc that knows how to compile nesC applications. If
invoked on regular C files, it behaves exactly like gcc. When invoked on a
nesC component or interface (.nc extension) file it compiles and links
(except if the usual <b>-c</b>, <b>-S</b>, <b>-E</b> or
<b>-fsyntax-only</b> options are used) that component with the other files
specified on the command line.

<p>
The additional options recognized by ncc over gcc are:

<p>
<b>-target=X</b> <blockquote> specify the target architecture
for this compilation. If pc is specified, the compilation uses the tossim
environment and produces a locally executable file. The default target is
mica, the possible targets are set by the TinyOS distribution (see the 
tos/platforms directory). A platform that is not in the TinyOS distribution
can be used if its directory is specified with an explicit -I directive
(the platform name is taken from the directory's name, platform directories
are recognised by the presence of a <code>.platform</code> file).
</blockquote>

<b>-tosdir=</b><u>dir</u><blockquote> specify the location of TinyOS. This
location can also be specified with the `TOSDIR' environment variable. If the
variable and the option are both given, ncc uses the value specified with
the option. If neither the environment variable or option are specified,
ncc uses its compiled-in TinyOS directory.</blockquote>

<b>-print-tosdir</b><blockquote> print the TinyOS directory to be used and
exit, taking into account the -tosdir option and `TOSDIR' environment
variable. No compilation occurs when -print-tosdir is used.</blockquote>

<b>-print-platforms</b><blockquote> print the valid TinyOS platforms,
including those made available by explicit -I directives (see -target 
discussion above).</blockquote>

<b>-nostdinc</b><blockquote> do not automatically include the TinyOS
directories in the search path. See the discussion of search paths below
for more details.</blockquote>

<b>-board=Y</b><blockquote> specify one (or more) sensor boards. This
effects the search path and preprocessor symbols. The set of boards is set
by the TinyOS distribution (see the tos/sensorboards
directory). As with targets, a sensorboard directory can be made
available via an explicit -I directive (sensorboard directories are
recognised by the presence of a <code>.sensor</code> file).</blockquote>

<b>-docdir=</b><u>dir</u><blockquote> generate documentation for the
compiled component in directory <u>dir</u>.</blockquote>

<b>-topdir=dir</b><blockquote> specify directory paths that should be
stripped from the source file names when generating "package names"
for the documentation files.  The directory above TOSDIR is
automatically added, so this option is only needed for directories
outside the main TinyOS distribution.
</blockquote>

<b>-graphviz=y|n</b><blockquote> explicitly enable or disable the use of the
graphviz tool in the generated documentation. Without this option, graphviz
is enabled iff the `dot' program is found in the current path. Use of
graphviz requires `dot'.  The documentation generation tool checks the
version of `dot', and enables client-side image maps, if supported.
</blockquote>

<b>-fnesc-tossim-tosnodes=</b><u>n</u><blockquote> specify the maximum
number of nodes that can be simulated in the tossim
environment.</blockquote>

<b>-fnesc-cfile=file</b><blockquote> specify a file in which to save the C
code generated when compiling a component. Note: if you specify two
components on the command line, then the C code from the second one will
overwrite the C code from the first.</blockquote>

There are a number of warnings specific to nesC, specified with 
<b>-Wnesc-X</b>, where X is (all these warnings are off by default):
<blockquote>
<li><b>fnptr</b>: Warn when function pointers are used (use of function
pointers is deprecated in nesC and leads to inaccurate data race
detection).

<li><b>async</b>: Warn when interrupt handlers call commands or events not
annotated with <b>async</b>.

<li><b>data-race</b>: Warn about potential data races.

<li><b>combine</b>: Warn when configuration wiring leads to "fan-out" and
the function return type does not have a combining function defined.

<li><b>docstring</b>: Warn when unexpected documentation strings (starting
with /**) are seen.

<li><b>all</b>: Turns on <b>fnptr</b>, <b>async</b>, <b>combine</b> and
<b>data-race</b>.
<li><b>error</b>: Turns the <b>fnptr</b>, <b>async</b>, <b>combine</b> and
<b>data-race</b> warnings into errors.
</blockquote>

<p>
When compiling a nesC component, the nesC compiler recognizes the gcc C
language (<b>-f...</b>) and warning (<b>-W...</b>) options. The <b>-S</b>,
<b>-c</b> and <b>-o</b> options work as usual, the <b>-x</b> option accepts
<b>nesc</b>. Directories can be added to nesC's search path with <b>-I</b>
(see the search path discussion below).

<p>
If you wish to compile a component Bar.nc to a C file, you can do:

<p>
<blockquote>
ncc -c -o /dev/null -fnesc-cfile=Bar.c Bar.nc
</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<h3>SEARCH PATH</h3>

<blockquote>
ncc performs the following substitutions on the directories specified with
the <b>-I</b> option: <b>%T</b> is replaced by the TinyOS directory,
<b>%p</b> is replaced by the selected target, <b>%%</b> is replaced by
<b>%</b>.

<p>Except when -nostdinc is specified, the search path for nesC components is
as follows, where <u>tosdir</u> is the TinyOS directory requested and
<u>target</u> is the selected target:

<ol>
<li>./
<li><b>-I</b> directives (in option order)
<li>%T/sensorboards/<u>boardname</u>, for each
<b>-board=</b><u>boardname</u> option specified (in option order) -
except if the sensorboard was found via an explicit -I directive
<li>%T/platform/%p  - except if the platform was found via an
explicit -I directive
<li>Additional directories requested by the selected target (e.g.,
%T/platform/avrmote for the mica target)
<li>%T/interfaces
<li>%T/system
<li>%T/lib
<li>`NESCPATH' environment variable directories (note that %T and %p
subsitution is not performed on these directories).
</ol>

When <b>-nostdinc</b> is specified, the search path is simply:

<ol>
<li>./
<li><b>-I</b> directives
<li>`NESCPATH' environment variable directories
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>PREPROCESSOR SYMBOLS</h3>

<blockquote>
ncc defines the following preprocessor symbols:

<ul>
<li>
NESC (since v1.1) set to XYZ where x.yz is the nesC version

<li>
PLATFORM_<u>target</u> (where <u>target</u> is the selected target name,
converted to upper case)

<li>
BOARD_<u>boardname</u> for each <b>-board=</b><u>boardname</u> option (the
boardname is converted to upper case)
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h3>

<blockquote>
If the -tosdir=dir option is not used, the `TOSDIR' environment variable
specifies the location of TinyOS.

<p>
`NESCPATH' is a colon separated list of additional search directories for
nesC components.
</blockquote>

<h3>SEE ALSO</h3>

<blockquote>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

ncc is built over nescc, which handles the non-TinyOS-specific
functionality of ncc. Users of nesC in a non-TinyOS context may
prefer to use nescc (see the source code of ncc and nescc for
details).

The warnings for the new nesC 1.1 features (see <code>-Wnesc-all</code>)
are off by default to increase compatibility with nesC 1.0 code. To match
the language specification in the nesC 1.1 reference manual, you should
compile with <code>-Wnesc-all</code> and <code>-Wnesc-error</code>. These
options will become the default in future releases.
