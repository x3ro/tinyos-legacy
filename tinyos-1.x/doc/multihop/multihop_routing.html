<p>The TinyOS-1.1 release and later include library components that provide 
ad-hoc multi-hop routing for sensor sensor network applications.&nbsp; The 
implementation uses a shortest-path-first algorithm with a single destination 
node (the root) and active two-way link estimation. The data movement and route 
decision engines are split into separate components with a single interface 
between them to permit other route-decision schemes to be easily integrated in 
the future. Use the multi-hop router is essentially transparent to applications 
(provided they correctly use the interface).</p>

<p>The multi-hop implementation consists of two core modules, <tt>MultiHopEngineM</tt> 
and <tt>MultiHopLEPSM</tt>, wired together in a single configuration, <tt>MultiHopRouter</tt>. 
Figure 1 provides an overview of the configuration.</p>

<b>Figure 1: <tt>MultiHopRouter</tt> configuration. Direction of arrows indicates
<br>
interface provider/user relationships NOT data flow direction.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Interface Description:</i></b>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The component configuration exports 6 interfaces.&nbsp; A '[ ]' after the 
interface name indicates the interface is parameterized. For more information on 
the specifics of the interface, consult the associated '.nc' interface 
definition files.</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>StdControl</tt> - The standard control interface</li>
  <li><tt>RouteControl</tt> - A special interface for controlling monitoring 
  router 
  operation. See the '<tt>RouteControl.nc</tt>' interface description file for more 
  information.</li>
  <li><tt>Receive[]</tt> - In this implementation, the base station is the only implicit 
  destination for packets. This interface exists only as a stub and is not 
  implemented. </li>
  <li><tt>Send[]</tt> - The port to use for locally originated packets.</li>
  <li><tt>Intercept[]</tt> - This port is used when a packet is received that WILL be 
  forwarded. It provides a means for an application to examine forwarded 
  traffic and, depending on the value returned, suppress the forwarding 
  operation.</li>
  <li><tt>Snoop[]</tt> - The <tt>Snoop</tt> port uses the '<tt>Intercept</tt>' interface definition, but 
  with different semantics. It is signaled when a packet is received that WILL 
  NOT be forwarded. This interface is useful for passive monitoring of 
  traffic for replication purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Component Description:</i></b></p>
<p><tt>MultiHopEngineM</tt> - Provides the overall packet movement logic for 
multi-hop functionality. Using the <tt>RouteSelect</tt> interface, it determines the 
next-hop path forwards them out the parameterized SendMsg port. The mechanics of 
this module are independent of route selection. It only requires that the <tt>RouteSelect</tt> 
and <tt>RouteControl</tt> interfaces be available from the algorithmic component. </p>
<p><tt>MultiHopLEPSM</tt> - Provides the Link Estimation and Parent Selection (LEPS) 
mechanisms for the multi-hop implementation. The module monitors all traffic 
received at the node (via the Snoop port) and directly receives single-hop route 
update messages (<tt>AM_MULTIHOPMSG</tt>) that may be sent from neighbors within the 
single hop range. Internally, this module manages the nearest available 
neighbors and decides the next hop destination based on shortest path semantics.&nbsp; 
Presently, the destination is identified as the node with <tt>TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS</tt> set 
to 0. By default, the module sends a route update message once every 10 seconds and 
re-computes after 50 seconds (5 route update messages). <tt>MultiHopLEPSM</tt> may 
be interchanged with other modules that implement different selection 
algorithms.&nbsp; </p>
<p><tt>MultiHopRouter</tt> - This configuration connects <tt>MultiHopEngineM</tt>, <tt>MultiHopLEPSM</tt> 
with other necessary components. The configuration exports the <tt>Receive</tt>, <tt>Send</tt>, 
and <tt>Intercept</tt> and <tt>Snoop</tt> (as <tt>Intercept</tt>) ports to applications. The <tt>SendMsg</tt> 
port of <tt>MultiHopEngineM</tt> is wired to the <tt>QueuedSend</tt> library components for 
queuing outbound packets (both forwarded and locally originated). The <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt> 
and <tt>SendMsg</tt> ports of <tt>MultiHopLEPSM</tt> are wired to the <tt>AM_MULTIHOPMSG</tt> parameter of 
the communication provider for the purpose of exchanging single-hop route 
updates with neighbors.</p>

<p>Use of the multi-hop library component is mostly transparent to the 
application. Any application that uses the Send interface can be connected 
to this component to achieve multi-hop functionality. One limitation of 
multi-hop, however, is the aggregate data rate. Applications should 
maintain average message frequency at or below one message every 2 seconds. 
Higher rates can lead to congestion and or overflow of the communication queue.</p>

<p><i><b>Surge</b></i></p>

<p>The Surge application, in <tt>apps/Surge</tt>, is a simple example of a mutlihop application.&nbsp; 
Surge takes light sensor readings and sends them over the mesh to the base node 
(Node 0). Accompanying this application is a Java program that can be used to 
visualize the logical network topology and the sensor readings. Users are 
encouraged to review the application, <tt>SurgeM.nc</tt>, and it's configuration, 
<tt>Surge.nc</tt>, to better understand how to use the multi-hop tools.</p>

<p>To build the Surge mote application, change to the <tt>apps/Surge</tt> directory and 
issue a '<tt>make &lt;platform&gt;</tt>' where <tt>platform</tt> is the name of your target mote type. 
To build the java tools, change to the <tt>tools/java/net/tinyos/surge</tt> director and 
issue '<tt>make</tt>'</p>

<p>Install the application onto the target nodes, giving each node a unique 
address. Remember, the node with address 0 will be the base station. This node 
should be connected to a PC via a serial or network link.</p>

<p>To run the java application, first start the necessary serial forwarder 
helpers needed to link the base node and the PC. Start the java tool, i.e&nbsp; 
'<tt>java net.tinyos.surge.MainClass &lt;GroupId&gt;</tt>', where <tt>GroupId</tt> is the AM group id 
used when compiling the mote application. When the application starts, you 
should immediately see the base node reporting sensor values. After about 
1 minute, other nodes should appear as the network topology builds. </p>
