Kamin Whitehouse's <b>Hood</B> has been moved to the core. 
Hood provides a Distributed Programming Abstraction for 
sensor networks and includes
5 new tinyos libraries to: 1) automatically define a
namespace of node attributes such as location, sensor values, etc,
which is exposed through a central 'registry' 2) store these
attributes to flash 3) expand that namespace to attributes of
neighbors (hood) 4) expose arbitrary functions, including the get/set
functions of registry attributes to other nodes and/or the pc through
an rpc interface 5) expose arbitrary module variables through the same
rpc interface.  These libraries require code generation and must be
used with nesc 1.2 or later. The code generation scripts are in
tinyos-1.x/tools/scripts/codeGeneration. 
<p>
You can read an overview of hood and find pointers to papers
at <a href="
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kamin/projects.html">Kamin's project page</a>.
Further documentation can be found at the
<a href="http://nest.cs.berkeley.edu/nestfe/index.php/Hood">Hood wiki</a>.
<p>
<b>Drip/Drain</b>.
Gilman Tolle's Drip and Drain work has been moved from beta into the core
(tinyos-1.x/lib).  Drip is a transport-layer component for epidemically
disseminating messages throughout a network; Drain is a collection
routing layer. Drip/Drain comes with extensive server-side java tools
and test applications. You can read more about the Drip and Drain protocols in
the README files in their respective beta directories: beta/Drip and
beta/Drain.
<p>
<b>pytos.</b> Kamin Whitehouse's pytos is a
python-based toolchain for tinyos with a dynamic typing system.  It
automatically imports the enums, types, message formats, modules,
variables, and rpc functions from applications that are compiled with
the 'rpc' and 'nescDecls' targets. 
<p>
pytos includes several utilities such as the ParseArgs.py utility to
parse the motecom and platform arguments from the commandline and
Listen.py that pretty prints all incoming packets, even
if they come in over a routing layer such as Drain (see below).  
MessageSnooper is a library that knows about all routing layers.  It uses
introspection to see which routing layers are compiled into the
application and registers for all packet types for all routing layers.
<p>
Please see the following two wiki pages for pytos documentation:
<a href="http://today.cs.berkeley.edu/nestfe/index.php/Pytos_Installation_Instructions">
Pytos Installation Instructions</a> and
<a href="http://today.cs.berkeley.edu/nestfe/index.php/Pytos_Development_Environment">
Pytos Development Environment </a>.
<p>
<b>Deluge</b> has had a general code cleanup. The trickle timer period has been 
increased by two orders of magnitude. Rebooting to the same image is now possible. 
Can ping a specific node ID. Server-side java tools allow rebooting even when
one or more nodes not running Deluge as expected. TOSBoot size has been 
reduced for the MSP
platform. TOSBoot will fail if the program image starts at the wrong address
(program too small or compiled for a different bootloader/revision).

<p>
Deluge now forwards messages that are not only valid deluge messages, 
but also do not have image numbers greater than what is
supported (could occur when running nodes with different number of
images) (Jonathan Hui).
<p>
Fixed a bug in msp430hardware.h:_nesc_atomic_sleep(). If timerA is
used by a module (such as the ADC) for triggering samples, the DCO
must stay on.  If the samples are recovered by the DMA, then the
timerA interrupt enable bit is not set (since the DMA handles the ifg
flag being set).  In this case, you want to check if timerA is NOT in
"stop_mode", and if it is using a clock source that relies on the
DCO. (Joe Polastre)
<p>
Fixed LED PowerState bug so that PowerState's version of the LEDs 
now reflects reality (Viktor Schnayder).

<b>Deluge 2.0</b>.
Version 2 of Deluge, TinyOS's state-of-the-art network programming
system, has been moved from beta into the main tree and is now the default
version for both AVR and MSP430 platforms. 
Among many significant Deluge
changes, the TOSBoot bootloader is now installed <i>by default</i>
when installing any TinyOS application. This policy is implemented
by setting TINYOS_NP ?= BNP in tools/make/Makedefaults. The user can 
override the policy by setting TINYOS_NP=x where x is anything != to BNP.
TOSBoot also provides on/off capability for telosb and tmote sky nodes
by holding the user button when resetting a node.
You can read in detail about Deluge 2.0 at the 
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ejwhui/research/deluge/">
Deluge web site</a>.
<p>
<b>More sample apps.</b>Several apps have been moved from tinyos-1.x/beta into the core apps directory
tinyos-1.x/apps: GlowRadio, GlowLeds, Pong, SurgeTelos, TelosADC 
and TelosPWM. To support these apps, the following libraries 
were also moved from beta into the core: lib/Oscope, lib/LedsIntensity
and lib/MultiHopLQI.
<p>
<b>New Flash Support.</b>
New Flash support for new Flash BlockStorage interfaces have been
added for the AT45DB and STM25P flash chips (found in the Mica family).
Among other things, this allowed Deluge 2.0, which requires these
new interfaces, to be ported to all of the Mica motes. 
<p>
Several improvements to the <b>TOSBase</b> bridge application:
<ul>
<li>
Replaced buffer-swapping queues with buffer-copying queues. This
works around a buffer-swapping bug in the CC2420 radio stack that we
have been unable to pin down and fix. This change does fix the bug
that causes the TOSBase to return 0-length packets under heavy
load. Using memcpy instead of buffer swapping does not appear to
impose a noticeable performance penalty.
<li>Fixed the bug discovered by Michael Newman, in which
PROTO_PACKET_NOACK packets are not bridged from UART to Radio.
<li>Increased the size of the task queue to lower the chance of a post
failure. 
</ul>
<p>
The <b> Hamamatsu sensor </b> has a slightly different interface in
that it is no longer necessary to set the ADC pin SEL functionality; 
this is done automatically by MSP430ADC12M. ADCSingle and ADCMultiple 
interfaces have been added to the PAR and TSR sensors. 
Lastly,
the drivers have been cleaned up. The new driver has new features
not found in any previous version of the humidity sensor driver.
These features include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>fewer race conditions and, where appropriate, more uses of the 'norace' keyword
    to eliminate spurious warnings.
<li>removed HumidityProtocolC to avoid misuse. 
<li> cleaned up code to remove those pesky <i>called asynchronously</i> messages. 
</ul>

<p>
<b>Motelist.</b>
Motelist for Linux kernels 2.6.x now requires only the /sys filesystem such
that superuser access is no longer necessary to read special files.
Alos fixed motelist for procfs in kernel 2.4.x to show the correct usb path given
in usbserial not usb/devices.

<p>
Bug fix to tos/platform/micaz/VoltageM.nc; state was not getting reset to S_IDLE
(Razvan Musaloiu).
<p>
Fixed critical bug that would cause InternalFlash to misbehave after
128 writes. Wasn't casting a variable to int8_t before testing its
sign (Jonathan Hui).
<p>
Bug fix in CC2420RadioM.nc for race condition in
CC2420 radio stack: If ACK comes in before PacketSent() runs, the
PacketSent() task could be posted twice (duplicate sendDone
events). Fix: set the state to a different value to suppress the later
task (Matt Welsh).
<p>
Fixed bug in java/net/tinyos/message/MoteIF.java 
where if source was started before MoteIF initialiser called, 
source.awaitStartup() wasn't called because of a prior
	 exception when attempting to start source (David Gay).
<p>
The problem observed was that timers in TOSSIM sometimes fire
early. This happened because of a bad interaction between how TOSSIM
emulates the hardware counter and how it handles time events 
(David Tucker).
<p>
Bug fix in Mate VM Hamamatsu sensor implementation 
where the HamamatsuM.TSR was 
accidentally wired to the HamamatsuC.PAR rather than
Hamamatsu.TSR. (Mark Kranz)

<b>New DemoSensorC</b> component added to Mica Weatherboard sensorboard.
<p>
<b>tos/interfaces/HPLPowerManagement interface </b>now has enable() and
disable() commands to enable proper nested usage. 
<p>
<b>Deluge:</b> improved error-case handling in bootloader and added image
verification by checking CRCs. Reduced bootloader codesize by about
1.5K; GoldenImage now compiles to 20894 bytes (in
nesc-1.2alpha7). Overhead of including Deluge in SurgeTelos is 7746
bytes, which includes the storage stack.
<p>
Code cleanup for <b>MSP430's internal flash</b>; reduces code size by
nearly 25%.
<p>
Because Deluge's StdControl.init() configures TOS_LOCAL_ADDRESS,
moved <b> MultiHop basestation initialization </b>from 
StdControl.init() to StdControl.start().

<p>
<b>Matlab documentation</b> in tools/matlab/doc has been consolidated 
into a single FAQ in the same directory and updated the 
tutorial in doc/matlab.html.
<p>
<p>
Make system additions:
<ul>
<li>
The make system includes more <b>support for the nesdoc</b> documentation
generator. A new command line option <i>docs,here</i> 
(or the corresponding DOCS=here environment variable definition) 
creates nesdoc documentation in doc/ in the current app directory. 
You can also define and export the DOCS environment variable to make this
the default. Modified the definition of the environment variable 
TOPDIR to support applications that are <i>not</i> located under 
$TOSDIR/.. . The user is also free to define
additional directories in NESDOC_TOPDIRS, which will take precendence.
<li>if <b>TOS_IMAGE_REPO</b> is set, 
tos_image.xml is copied to $(TOS_IMAGE_REPO)/$(COMPONENT).$(PLATFORM).xml
for additional convenience in an interactive environment.
<li> Keep DEFAULT_PROGRAM for backward
compatibility, but also add <b>DEFAULT_PROGRAM_AVR and DEFAULT_PROGRAM_MSP </b>that
take precedence for defaults, so that a default can be specified and
not conflict with other platforms.
<li><b>Support networked BSL invocation</b>. Syntax is IP:PORT as in
192.168.1.77:10002 or shorthand as in <i>77.2</i> where the 77 is
prefixed with the value in NETBSL_HOSTPORT_PREFIX, which defaults to
<i>192.168.1.</i>, and the 2 is added to 10000.  This applies to the
netbsl.extra parameter as well -- so you could write
netbsl,192.168.1.77:10002 or equivalently netbsl,77.2.

Removed some atomic sections from around commands in
MSP430 platform-specific files where
(1) the command compiles to a single MSP instruction and (2) it doesn't
break Deluge for some unknown reason. 
(Recommended by Henri Dubois-Ferriere, EPFL)
<p>
Added code to help with serial problems between Linux 2.6, USB serial
ports, and the MIB510. These changes included changing the port
settings and adding a retry if the programmer doesn't respond
initially. Also changed the COMn reference to /dev/ttySn to help
Cygwin work better.(David Gay, Intel Berkeley)
<p>
Fixed a bug in CC1000ControlM.nc where the incorrect register was 
written. (Joe Polastre, UCB, SF Bug#1110032) 
<p>
Fixed CC1000 stack to work if someone specifies a 0-length packet. (Joe Polastre, UCB)

In CC2420 stack, added additional protection on starting and stopping the SPI bus.
Keeps track of whether the component is busy doing something before
disabling SPI.  Also added more protections in other functions for
enable/disable.
<p>
In preparation for TinyOS 2.0, many components are being rewritten
according to TEP (TinyOS Enhancement Protocol) 101. You can read TEP
101 (currently in draft form) on the <a
href="http://www.tinyos.net/scoop/special/working_group_tinyos_2-0">TinyOS
2.0 Working Group page</a>. Please also refer to other TEPS on that
page.  Along these lines code has committed an HPL for the telos DMA
and other components. Please refer to the <a
href="http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/mailman/listinfo/tinyos-commits">
http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/mailman/listinfo/tinyos-commits</a>
archives for full details.
<p>
A new <b>Voltage Component</b> replaced the old one in tos/system. The
new component's interface returns the ADC value in millivolts, and
uses new underlying platform-specific voltage modules. On the msp430
platform, the voltage module automatically switches between 1.5 and
2.5V reference voltage depending on what the measured system voltage.
Allows for accurate sampling of voltages above 3V. The conversion was
carefully coded to reduce computation time but does include one integer 
divide; those concerned about this computation time can use the ADC 
interface directly.
<p>
Rewrite for MSP430 DCO calibration/init methods. Single calibration/initialization gains include: order of 
magnitude faster (9ms), 2/3 smaller (74 ROM bytes), 5-8 bytes less RAM.
Using this calibration routine, have successfully transmitted over the
UART at up to 1Mbaud (though 256Kbaud appears overall more robust). Continual/sliding-mode recalibration improvements include: the DCO can be adjusted by about 0.35% every two seconds; this routine can account for
a change of about 0.5 degC / sec. Please see 
<a href="http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/pipermail/tinyos-commits/2005-March/005959.html">http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/pipermail/tinyos-commits/2005-March/005959.html</a> for details.

The <b>ncc</b> family of tools (ncc, mig, ncg, nesdoc) has moved from
the nesc project's source tree into the TinyOS source tree. ncc can be
found in tools/src/ncc.
<p>
tools/scripts/taskCount.pl will count the number of tasks in an application
for you. For example, to count the tasks in Blink for the telos
platform, do 'taskCount.pl telos'. (You must compile the application beforehand.)

Bug fixed where when stop is called on HPLCC2420M while it is in the middle of an operation
then the while(spi_action) loops never return and system is hosed.
By including an enable flag, the loops break out and program execution
continues. (Joe Polastre, UCB)
<p>
Merged in proposed changes suggested by Anders Blomdell, who wants bsl to
recognize a mote reference number and deduce the serial port.  Modified
his original submission to recognize bsl,ref,<ref> instead of bsl,<ref> to
avoid any ambiguity between serial port names and reference names. (Anders
Blomdell, Lund University, Sweden)
<p>
Tweaks to build-mspgcc to make it more robust: added some 
exit code under certain conditions and modified how BUILD_BASE is
defined. (Henri Dubois-Ferriere, EPFL, Switzerland) Another tweak to
enable use within firewalls (David Gay, Intel).
<p>
Slow down broken I2C, so that the mda300ca digital I/O stuff works. This involved changing a wait in the I2C task from a nop to a TOSH_uwait(1). (David Gay, Intel)
<p>
Updated enable/disable functions or msp430 USARTs to appropriately change the pin functionality when enable or disable are called. (Jonathan Hui, UCB)

<b>MSP430. In preparation for TinyOS 2.0, many MSP430 platform components are being
rewritten according to TEP (TinyOS Enhancement Protocol) 101. You can

</b>MSP430ADC12[Advanved|Basic] has been replaced by
MSP430ADC12[Single|Multiple]; high-frequency sampling of above 70ksps
is now available.  HIL (see TEP 101 for what HIL means)now provides
ADCSingle and ADCMultiple (to stay compatible also ADC and ADCControl
are provided). The MSP430 platform also saw the initial checkin of
hardware I2C module driver for. The I2C module the
f15x and f16x series of microcontrollers as well as any others that
have the built-in hardware I2C module. Details on the msp430 I2C interface
are <a href="http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/pipermail/tinyos-commits/2005-January/005806.html">

<b>Telos B.</b>A more efficient CRC calculation has been added 
by providing a method in the HPL. A new component, I2CPacket, was committed
which uses the new I2C functionality described above; I2CPacket is responsible
for obtaining exclusive access of the I2C bus (in the case of telosb,
it is shared with SPI and UART) starting the I2C component (MSP430I2CM
in our case), running the operation, and then stopping the I2C
component (which restores the previous settings for the USART, such as
SPI configuration for the radio). More details on I2CPacket can be found <a

The TinyOS RPMS sets the MAKERULES environment variable to point to 
the new make system in tools/make. If you want to use the old 
system simply comment out where MAKERULES is defined in 
the file /etc/profile.d/tinyos.sh. If MAKERULES is not defined the
old make system will be used.

New options to support Debian linux were added to motelist-linux2:
<ol>
<li>Add -f to specify /tmp/usb-serial 
<li>add -dev_prefix to override standard /dev/
prefixes, which currently search /dev/usb/tts/ and /dev/ttyUSB.
</ol>
Added functionality to avr makefile for compiling frequency
into app via the make extra flags. See /tools/make/avr/freq.extra.

Additional radio configuration tweaks are available for the CC2420 radio: 
<ul>
<li>When radio is turned on, frequency is set to a value other than the
    default, the radio is turned off, and then turned back on again,
    the radio tunes back to the default frequency.  This code also fixes the bug
    by using the cached radio frequency setting.
<li>GetPreset (nearest) and GetFrequency are now available through the
    CC2420Control interface
<li>bit/byte/symbol timing available from CC2420Const.h (soon to be exposed

Since 1.1.6, TinyOS has included an alternative make system which
allows easier introduction of platforms. We have not made this make
system the default, however, because it requires make 3.8 which (1)
not everyone has and (2) has some bugs which are tickled by some of
TInyOS's major subsystems. Towards fixing (2), Phil Levis has provided
a patch for make 3.8. We have included a patched make executable in
tools/make (the executable is also present in 1.1.8).

On the <b>TI MSP430 platform</b>, each sensor now has its own header file with constants for interface ID and the "adcPort" parameter.
This makes code cleaner and saves RAM, since uniqueCount("ADCPort") now reflects the actual number of interfaces wiring to ADCC. Some files 
in the corresponding platforms were modified to take into account the new msp430 definitions. (Jan-Hinrich Hauer, TU Berlin.)

TinyOS 1.1.8 includes the new network programming system called
<b>Deluge</b> . Deluge provides the ability to wirelessly install a
new program image. This is accomplished by propagating a program image
over the wireless network and having each node program themselves with
the new image. 
See the <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jwhui/research/projects/deluge/"> 
 Deluge web site </a> for more information on how to start programming 
your motes wirelessly with Deluge.
</p>

<p>
Initial checkin of the InternalFlash interface. This is a generic
interface for reading and storing values in the internal flash of a
microcontroller. This generic interface is necessary since different
platforms have different requirements when writing values to internal
flash. For example, on the msp the entire segment which encloses the
intended write location must first be erased. Some software logic is
required to make sure all other values not at the intended write
location are preserved. However, on the avr platform (which has an
EEPROM), an erase of an entire segment is not required.
</p>

<p>
Replaced the CC2420 stack with new interrupt-driven stack.
New interfaces (Capture and Interrupt) signal radio interrupts
on a platform independent basis and allow time stamping information
to propogate up through the radio stack.  This interrupt driven
radio stack is needed to support time stamping as well as low
power listening.
</p>

<p>
Introduced a Quick/Fast CRC calculation for MSP430 based platforms.

1.1.8 includes many bug fixes in the 
</p>
<p>
Patch submitted by David Moore to fix a condition under which the
CC1000 stack hangs due to a task queue starvation problem. Details
can be found at 
<a href="http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/pipermail/tinyos-commits/2004-August/004891.html">
http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/pipermail/tinyos-commits/2004-August/004891.html</a>. The fix 
was to only make some relatively expensive calls if a post succeeded rather than whether or
not the post succeeded; not making those calls gives the task queue enough time to run in the case 
that the post failed due to task queue overflow. 
</p>
<p>
Bug reported by Thanos Stathopoulos which occured in CC1000 stack
when acks were enabled and broadcast messages were sent. 
This fix causes the radio to only wait for an ack if the
message is unicast, otherwise it transitions to the TX_DONE state.
Details are at
<a href="http://mail.millennium.berkeley.edu/pipermail/tinyos-commits/2004-August/004990.html">

<p>
This patch fixes two sources of Timer error. The first is when a task
post fails: TimerM now sets state appropriately and does not blindly
assume it was able to fire its timers. The second is when adjusting
the firing interval in very small amounts. In the old version, a
subtle race condition could cause TimerM to set the compare register
to a past value. Instead of firing in 1ms, it would fire in 256 ms,
which completely threw all timers off.
<p>
For full details on this patch, refer to the discussion on the
tinyos-devel list under the threads "mica* TimerM" and "TimerM.nc
changes" on Aug. 9-12 2004.

Bug fix from Hardy Griech in tos/lib/MultiHopLQI: update interval

<p>
Add hardware platform abstraction component for <b>Mic component</b>
to fix the cross-platform interrupt issues.  TONE_INTR compiling issue
is also resolved.

<p>
A number of changes to the <b> simulation tools</b>. Please
see the tinyos-1.x/ChangeLog for details.
</p>

<p>
<b> MACControl interface change.</b>
MacControl no longer has the Backoff events in it.  It seemed that
people really just wanted to turn ACKs on and off and likewise other
radio functionality but not worry about changing the backoff.  As a
result, there are two interfaces--MacControl and MacBackoff and you
can wire to the appropriate one.  The CC2420 radio stack also has
these two interfaces.
</p>

<p>
<b> Task scheduling. </b> You can now change the size of the task queue 
by adding -DTOSH_MAX_TASKS_LOG2=n (to get 2^n tasks) to the compile
command line via, say, a Makelocal file.

TinyOS 1.1.3 includes <b>Tython</b>. 
Tython is a TOSSIM scripting environment that uses a Java
implementation of the Python programming language. Tython allows users
to write scripts to do things such as dynamically move motes, inject
packets, and inspect the internal state of the simulation. Tython
allows full access to the existing Java TinyOS toolchain, so users can
write a piece of TinyOS messaging code, generate a Java packet object
from it using mig, then use Tython to inject those packets into a
running simulation. 
<P>Tython is integrated with the TinyViz environment;
this means that, for example, if a script makes a mote move, a user
can see the movement in the TinyViz visualization and its radio
connectivity will be updated as expected. TinyViz and Tython can be
run separately from one another.<p>
For more information about Tython, please see the User Manual in the doc/tython directory.

<p> This section outlines the changes that have occured in TinyOS
since the last major release (1.1.0) and the 1.1.1 minor release.
The changes in 1.1.1 include a more reliable routing implementation, a 
calibrated interface to the ADC as well as various bug fixes.
<p>

    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0ff">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>
TinyOS 1.1.1 includes a <b>new routing module, named MintRoute</b> 
with increased reliability. The algorithm features 
improved parent selection leading to relatively shorter trees. 
</p>
A <b> new ADC interface </b> allows for calibrated and non-calibrated
(legacy) ADC reads by providing two additional methods to control
reference value calibration. The new interface is used by default, but
supports legacy ADC reads. See the ADCControl.nc file for more
information.
<p>
<b>The TinySec usage model has changed</b>.  Rather than having to wire to
SecureGenericComm to use TinySec, you can now leave your wiring files the same
and simply use TINYSEC=true on the command line. Example:
<code>
    make mica2 TINYSEC=true
</code>
This works with any application using the Makerules in the apps
directory. The methods for changing the security mechanism used
(authentication, authentication+encryption, or CRC) for transmission
still use the TinySecMode interface exported by TinySecC, but will likely 
change in the next release.
</p>
<p>
There is now a <b>reset target</b> in Makerules: make <i>platform</i> reset.
