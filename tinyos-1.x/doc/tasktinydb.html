TASK is a suite of Java utilities that allows you to manage
a network of motes deployed for remote data collection.  It includes: 
<ul> 
<li> A deployment tool for recording the position of sensors on a map, 
<li> A configuration tool for specifying a <i>query</i> consisting of a
data collection rate and a set of physical attributes to collect,
<li> Several visualization tools for monitoring the status of the network
and the real-time value of the various attributes in the query and,
<li> A database interface that logs each query and result collected
from the network and allows offline browsing of collected data in 
a variety of applications.
</ul>
<p>
For more information about using and installing TASK, see the <a
href="http://berkeley.intel-research.net/task">TASK Web Site</a>.
Once you have set up TASK on your computer, you can read more about
the Java utilities in the 
the TASK documentation included with the release in the file
<font face="courier">docs/TASKVisualizer.pdf</font>.

<tr><td> TinyDB 0.2 is also included in this package.
TinyDB provides the mote-side functionality for TASK -- it enables you
to collect data from a sensor network by specifying a simple query
which will periodically return a set of sensor readings or a statistical
summary (<i>aggregate</i>) of a set of readings.  
<p>
TinyDB was originally included with TinyOS 1.0, but version 0.2 adds a 
number of new features.  For more information about TinyDB, including
a list of new features, see
the <a href="http://telegraph.cs.berkeley.edu/tinydb">TinyDB website</a> or the
TinyDB documentation included with this release in the <font face="courier">docs/TinyDB.pdf</font> file.
