<div class="grayheader">Overview</div>

<p>
   Tython is an environment for testing and analyzing sensor network
   applications. Tython is itself not a program simulator -- it uses
   TOSSIM to model TinyOS execution.
</p>

<p>
   Tython compliments TOSSIM executions by adding a full featured
   scripting environment to augment the simulation. This allows users
   to build on top of and extend Tython to meet application specific
   requirements. This also significantly helps the debugging process,
   allowing an arbitrarily complicated experiment to be repeatedly
   executed on successive versions of the code.
</p>

<p>
   Tython also includes flexible environmental models to accommodate a
   wide range of applications and real world scenarios. Users can
   thereby include in their program simulations a wide range of models
   for environmental effects. Furthermore, the Tython implementation
   is extensible, allowing developers to augment the included models
   with specific ones relevant for a particular application.
</p>

<p>
   Tython is distributed as part of <a href="http://www.tinyos.net/">
   TinyOS</a>.
