<p><i>Protocol:</i></p>
<p>The protocol used by TinyOS-1.1 is loosely based on the PPP in HDLC-like 
framing described in RFC-1662. It uses the same framing and escape 
sequences and a 16-bit CRC. The protocol always assumes 
Address-and-Control field compression. The implementation understands the 
Protocol IDs in Table 1. All other protocols are rejected.</p>

<p><i>Components:</i></p>
<p>The following components implement the framing protocol on the TinyOS device:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><tt>FramerM</tt>:</b> The TinyOS module that provides the core framing protocol. It 
  provides the <tt>BareSendMsg</tt>, <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt> and <tt>TokenReceiveMsg</tt> interfaces. The 
  <tt>TokenReceiveMsg</tt> interface is used when handling packets that require 
  acknowledgements. The interface extends the <tt>ReceiveMsg</tt> interface by 
  including a field for the token on the receiver and a new command, 
  <tt>ReflectToken()</tt>, that triggers the ACK process. The use of acknowledgements 
  is intended as a simple flow control scheme to prevent exceeding buffering 
  capacities on a TinyOS device.</p>
  <p><tt><b>FramerAckM:</tt></b> A generic module that implements ACK processing for inbound 
  packets. It is intended to be used in lieu of applications that 
  specifically handle ACKs. </p>
  <p><b><tt>UARTFramedPacket:</tt></b> A configuration component that incorporates both <tt>FramerM</tt> 
  and <tt>FramerAckM</tt>. It exports the same interface as <tt>UARTNoCRCPacket</tt> and can 
  be used interchangeably with that component. The default UART communication 
  provider for <tt>GenericComm</tt> in TinyOS-1.1 is <tt>UARTFramedPacket</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Applications:</i></p>
<p>The following applications are provided for simple interfacing to a TinyOS 
network:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><tt>TOSBase (apps/TOSBase)</tt></b>: An application that acts as a simple bridge between 
  the serial and wireless channel. It is similar to the older <tt>GenericBase</tt>, but 
  incorporates <tt>FramerM</tt>. TOSBase does not use <tt>FramerAckM</tt>, but implements 
  it's own ACK handling. Specifically, TOSBase will only ACK a packet 
  received from the serial channel once it has been transmitted over the radio. 
  TOSBase will only bridge those packets whose group id matches the value of the <tt>TOS_AM_GROUP</tt> 
  value compiled into the application.</p>
  <p><b><tt>TransparentBase (apps/TransparentBase)</tt></b>: A bridge identical to <tt>TOSBase</tt>, 
  except that it does not filter packets based on group id.</p>
  <p><b><tt>GenericBase (apps/GenericBase)</tt></b>: The legacy bridging application that does 
  not provide for framing or flow control. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Host Tools:</i></p>
<p>There are a variety of java-based tools that can be used to simplify serial 
communication using the new protocol. They include classes and a simple 
application, <tt>SerialForwarder</tt>. A key point with these tools is that they 
understand how to communicate with multiple types of <i>packet sources</i>.&nbsp; 
These include directly attached serial links, network links and simulated links 
using either the framed or legacy protocols. See the <a href="#Usage">Usage</a> 
section for more information on the specific types of packet sources.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><tt>net.tinyos.packet.PacketSource</tt></b> (Interface): This class provides a series of 
  standards methods to communicate with a TinyOS node on a per-packet basis.  It provides the basic semantics of open, close, readPacket and writePacket. 
  Refer to <tt>tools/java/net/tinyos/packet/PacketSource.java</tt> for more information.</p>
  <p><b><tt>net.tinyos.packet.PhoenixSource</tt></b> (Class): This class provides some 
  additional functionality above the standard PacketSource. PhoenixSource 
  spawns a thread that will initiate an upcall whenever a new packet arrives 
  from a serial channel. In the case of network based links, it will 
  attempt to reconnect to the channel if connectivity is lost.&nbsp; Refer to 
  toos/java/net/tinyos/packet/PhoenixSource.java for more information.</p>
  <p><b><tt>net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder</tt></b> (Application): The SerialForwarder acts as a 
  relay point between any packet source and network packet source. It's 
  intended use is to provide TCP/IP connectivity to a locally connected TinyOS 
  device. The <tt>SerialForwarder</tt> provides the capability of multiplexing 
  multiple network connections into a single connection. That is, multiple 
  remote applications can connect to a TinyOS node via the <tt>SerialForwarder</tt> (no 
  deterministic serialization is provided, however).</p>
