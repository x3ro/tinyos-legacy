Description:

Surge is an example application that uses MultiHop ad-hoc routing.  It
is designed to be used in conjunction with the Surge java tool. Each
Surge node takes light readings and forwards them to a base station.
The node can also respond to broadcast commands from the base.


Tools:

net.tinyos.surge.MainClass

This class processes sensor data from Surge programmed nodes via a
GenericBase station.  The java applet snoops the multihop headers to
provide a graphical view of the logical network topology.  It also
permits variation of the sample rates and sending pre-defined commands
to the surge nodes.

Known bugs/limitations:

(2/22/03) The 'Bcast' module provided w/ this application is temporary and will
be moved to a different location.
