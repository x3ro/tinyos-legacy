Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

SenseToLeds is an application that periodically 
samples the photo sensor and displays the highest 3 bits of the raw ADC
light reading to the LEDs, with RED being the most signficant bit 
and YELLOW being the least significant bit.  It behaves the same as 
Sense in Lesson 2; however, it is built simply by wiring TimerC, 
Photo, IntToLeds and SenseToInt components together.

Tools:

None

Known bugs/limitations:
