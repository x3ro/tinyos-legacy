README for MicaSBTest1

Description:
 
MicaSBTest1 is an application that test out the magnetometer, accelerometer, and temperature sensor.
It demonstrates how to access the data from each individual sensors, how to perform real time 
"calibration", and how to filter and process sensory data for the magnetometer.  

The test cases for the accelerometer and the temperature sensor is very simple.  The raw 10 bit data from
these sensors are sent over the UART for visual inspection.  The format of the packet looks like
the following: (24 bytes long, each data is 2 bytes long)

[TEMP ACCEL_X ACCEL_Y] [TEMP ACCEL_X ACCEL_Y] [TEMP ACCEL_X ACCEL_Y] [TEMP ACCEL_X ACCEL_Y] [TEMP ACCEL_X ACCEL_Y]

For the magnetometer, one can visually look at the LEDs to see if it is working.
RED - self calibration is being done
GREEN - idle -> no magnetic field event detected
Yellow - event triggered:  either X or Y axis has event detected. 

Tools:
 
None
 
Known bugs/limitations:
 
The new radio stack may only send 29 bytes instead of the usual 30 bytes packet. 
If this is true, you may lose the last byte for the packet sent over the UART.
