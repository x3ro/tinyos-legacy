README for SimpleCmd and SenseLightToLog
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

SimpleCmd module demonstrates a simple command interpreter for TinyOS tutorial 
(Lesson 8 in particular).  It receives a command message from its RF interface,
which triggers a command interpreter task to execute the command.
When the command is finished executing, the component signals the upper 
layers with the received message and the status indicating whether the message
should be further processed. 

As a simple version,  it can only interpret the follwoing commands:
Led_on (1), Led_off(2), radio_quieter(3), radio_louder(4), 
start_sensing(5), and read_log(6). Start sensing commands will trigger 
the Sensing.start interface while read log will read the EEPROM with 
a specific log line and broadcast the line over the radio when read is done.

SenseLightToLog module is used in Lesson 8 of our tutorial and it 
implements the Sensing and StdControl interface.  When a command to 
start sensing is received, it periodically samples the light sensor 
for N samples and also store it in the EEPROM.  Once N samples have 
been collected, the timer is turned off and the sense done event is
signalled.
