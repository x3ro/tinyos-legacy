TestUART is a test application for the UARTDebugger component.  
UARTDebugger drives a Scott Edwards Electronics LCD display and provides
an interface for writing text messages to the screen during runtime.
This test application prints an incrementing sequence of numbers
on the display.

Note that the display requires the UART to be set to 9600 bps (which the
component does on initialization), meaning that it cannot be used with
GenericComm / other components that may want to drive the UART at a faster
rate.

Also note that this test component WILL NOT WORK WITH CROSSBOW'S NEW
PROGRAMMING BOARD.  It works fine with the original Mica programming/uart
board, however.
