Testsuite for watchdog component. It currently shows three behaviors:

1. watchdog being properly activated, and reset periodically.  The
mote logically stays running.  The behavior on the leds should be as
follows: red and green led come on, after 2 seconds green goes off.
The red led stays on forever or until power outage or program crash
(which should not happen). This is the default build mode.

2. watchdog properly activated, but not reset by the application.
This is done by having the application reset the Watchdog from a one
shot timer that, you guessed it, fires only once.  The behavior should
be as follows: red and green LEDs come on, after 2 seconds green goes
off, and another 2.5 seconds later the mote resets. This mode is
enabled through 

WDTTEST=1 make mica2 install


3. In principle the watchdo should get petted: the timer is repeated,
etc. Unfortunately, there is a task that runs in an infinite loop;
that task is prohobiting the system to execute more tasks and
ultimately overflows the task queue.  Additionally, tasks like The
watchdog petting timer are blocked.  Guess what : this app needs to be
killed.  The observed behavior should be as follows: red and green led
come on, after 2 seconds green goes off, and almost immediately
afterwards the yellow light goes on.  2.5 seconds later the mote
resets and the process starts all over again.  To enable this mode,
build with

WDTTEST=2 make mica2 install
