Description:

Surge is an example application that uses MultiHop ad-hoc routing.  It
is designed to be used in conjunction with the Surge java tool. Each
Surge node takes temperature readings and forwards them to a base station.
The node can also respond to broadcast commands from the base.

This version of surge in contrib/ucb/SurgeTelos only supports
(and has been tested on) the Telos platform.  Please do not try to run
this version of Surge on any other platform.  Other platforms may use
Surge in tinyos-1.x/apps/Surge

Tools:

net.tinyos.surge.MainClass

This class processes sensor data from Surge programmed nodes via a
GenericBase station.  The java applet snoops the multihop headers to
provide a graphical view of the logical network topology.  It also
permits variation of the sample rates and sending pre-defined commands
to the surge nodes.

In tinyos-1.x/tools/java/net/tinyos/surge, you must recompile the java
classes based on this version of Surge:

    cd $TOSDIR/../tools/java/net/tinyos/surge
    make clean
    SURGE_PLATFORM=telos make

This creates classes from Surge.h and SurgeCmd.h in contrib/ucb/apps/Surge
and Multihop.h from contrib/ucb/tos/lib/MultiHopLQI.

Now you can run Surge with

    java net.tinyos.surge.MainClass 0x7D

Make sure SerialForwarder is connected to Telos before running the Surge
java GUI.
