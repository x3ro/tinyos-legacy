README for TestTinyAlloc
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

TestTinyAlloc tests the TinyAlloc dynamic memory allocator. It
allocates three chunks of memory, frees one of them, reallocates
(resizes) another, then compacts the allocated chunks, checking that
data hasn't been corrupted.

The red LED toggling denotes a clock heartbeat, from which all of the
operations occur. The green LED togging denotes correct operation; if
running properly, the red and green leds should toggle together. The
yellow LED denotes an error occuring.

Correct operation should have the green and red leds toggle five times
together, after which the red continues to toggle but the green
stops. The final state of the mote should be with the green LED on and
the red LED blinking at 1Hz.

Tools:

None.

Known bugs/limitations:
