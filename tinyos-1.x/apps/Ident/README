README for Ident

Description:

Ident is a simple person tracking application built with the Ident
component.

To use the Ident application, you need:
- program one GenericBase for communication with the Ident motes
- program at least one Ident mote
- compile tools/java/net/tinyos/message using the Makefile in that directory
- compile tools/java/net/tinyos/ident using the Makefile in that directory
- run the serial forwarder
- run the java ident applet with java net.tinyos.ident.Ident <group id>

The Ident motes have an identity, stored in EEPROM. This identity can be
cleared (for all Ident motes in radio range) by pressing the Clear IDs
button in the Java applet. The identity of all motes in radio range is
set by entering a string (up to 15 characters) in the box above the 
Set ID button, then pressing Set ID (so this is best done with only one
Ident mote on...).

An Ident mote will have its red led on if it has no id, it will blink its
green led every 10s if it does have an identity. The java applet will
display the IDs of all motes it hears, along with the time (in milliseconds
since 1970...) since it last heard them. A mote which isn't heard within
approximately 20s is removed from the list.

Note: if the applet doesn't work, check that you've used the right
group id...
