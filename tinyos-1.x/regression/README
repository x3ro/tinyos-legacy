A regression suite for TinyOS. The setup assumes you have two motes, each on a
programming board. 

Setup the motes and boards as follows:
- one mote is the "base" mote. Program it with TOSBase, and place it on
a programming board connected to the PC via a seriable cable on some
serial port (COMb).

- one mote is the "app" mote. Place it on a programming board connected to
the PC via a seriable cable on some serial port (COMa). If you're using
a parallel-port programming board, connect the PCs parallel port to this
board (the "base" mote does not need a programming cable).

Then, just run the runtests script with arguments:
  runtests MOTEKIND COMa COMb
where MOTEKIND is mica, mica2, etc (the pc target is currently unsupported).

You can run only some tests with
  runtests MOTEKIND COMa COMb TEST-REGEXP
where TEST-REGEXP is a regular expression matching the tests you wish to run.

Each test is composed of a number of (named) subtests, the first of which,
"app" is to compile and install a particular application. Further subtests
check that application's functionality.

The result of each subtest is printed, one of PASS, FAIL or SKIP (test
ignored for this MOTEKIND).

If you didn't specify a TEST-REGEXP, the last test is zzblink, which
installs Blink on your "app" mote, to avoid spamming the airwaves...

At the end, a summary of failed tests is printed. Detailed output from
a particular test can be found in output/TESTNAME/SUBTESTNAME.

To add a new test, see the ADDING-TESTS file.
