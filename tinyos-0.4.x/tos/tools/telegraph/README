TeleSensorProxy looks for motes with a MOTEINFO layer and adds them
as sources to Telegraph.

The setup of this directory is a little broken -- it requires a copy
of the following .java files to exist at the same level at TeleSensorProxy
and RemoteSource (these files are currently
checked in one layer higher).  Since no tos java files have packages
(why, I don't know), it's not really possible to import from the higher
level directory.

Required files:

AMInterface.java
AMHandler.java
Schema.java
SchemaField.java
SensorTracker.java
