Rutgers Mote Schematics
-----------------------

All schematics were drawn in OrCAD. If you don't have OrCAD you can view the Postscript files which were printed directly from the schematic sheets.

WARNING: These drawings should be considered the "Rutgers Interpretation" of Mote hardware. They may or may not faithfully represent the original designs! Modifications were made to the Magnetic Field sensor in particular. The other schematics should match the hardware, but no guarantees!
